         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Smyth &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with him, for holding (as it is reported by ſome that were of them) that their new waſhed companie is no true church, and that there cannot be in a church the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of baptiſme &amp; other ordinances of Chriſt, without Officers, contrarie to his former judgment, practiſe &amp; writings, &amp; yet reſteth not but is inquiring after a new way of walking, (as the ſame perſons affirme) breeding more errors, as is ſtrongly ſuſpected, and by his manuſcripts partly appeares. Whereby it is manifeſt, that theſe men can not cleare themſelves of inſtabilitie &amp; changeablenes in Religion, but are guilty of that inconſtancie that is worthy reproof and damnable.</p>
            <p>Further he ſayth, <hi>For a man of a Turke to become a Jew, of a Iew a Papiſt, of a Papiſt a Proteſtant, are al commendable changes &amp;c. ſo that not to change religion is evil ſimplie: &amp; therefore that we should fal from Puritaniſme to Browniſme, and from Browniſme to true chriſtian baptiſme, is not ſimply evil in it ſelf, except it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that we have fallen from the true religion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. Smyth would make the world beleeve (as it is the manner of al heretikes) that their alterations were goings forward to further truthes, and therefore commendable. But if their <hi>true Chriſtian baptiſme,</hi> (whereof they boaſt) prove a notable hereſie, (as it is indeed, &amp; in this Treatiſe is proved) then his compariſon holds not, but rather their eſtate is like to thoſe in 1 Tim. 1, 19. <hi>that put away fayth &amp; a good conſcience, and as concerning fayth, have made ſhipwrack.</hi> And that <hi>bring in damnable hereſies. 2 Pet. 2. 1. &amp;c.</hi> denying the covenant of grace, and the lawful uſe of the ſcriptures, &amp;c. <hi>to bring upon themſelves ſwift damnation,</hi> if God give them not ſpeedy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Next M. Smyth ſetts down the queſtions controverted, and hereafter anſwered, affirming that this controverſie is between them and the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas he might as well have ſayd, betweene them and all chriſtian churches, that have been or are at this day: for it is not we alone that

            </p>
            <p>This Challenger would fayne have the world to take notice, that he deales with an adverſary that is too weak to try out this controverſy with him, &amp; ſo to foreſtall mens judgments before ever they come to the reading of my anſwere. And becauſe he would not be ſeene to be the Author himſelfe of my diſgrace, he imputeth this report to the Rabbies of the Separation (as it pleaſeth him in his taunting maner to terme them) who (I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded) are guiltles thereof. But if any had ſo ſayd vnto him in private, yet doth he in publiſhing the ſame, breake the bounds of love. For myne owne parte, whether any have ſo ſpoken or not, it ſhal not offend me, I knowe the Lord meaſureth his guiftes to every one as he wil. 1 Cor. 12. 8.—11. I praiſe God for that I have, and do not envy, but reioyce in the graces that God beſtoweth vpon others, and pray that they may vſe them to his glory, and to edification. Notwithſtanding though Mr Smyth thinke me to weake to incounter with him, yet the Lord aſſiſting me, I meane not for all theſe his diſgraceful ſpeeches, to yeeld him the cauſe, or
<pb facs="tcp:23838:5"/> give back one foot from the defence thereof, knowing that the truth which I contend for: wil diſcover and convince his damnable errors: the which though he ſet a glorious ſhew vpon (as a marchant of falſe wares) by miſapplying of Scriptures: yet wil the falſehood of them appeare, to al ſuch whoſe eies God ſhal open, to diſcerne between the truth and lyes. Moreover if I in my weaknes, make to appeare how vnconſcionably &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly Mr Smyth dealeth againſt the truth: his glorious boaſting and Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine valour, will have the more diſgrace, then if he had dealt with men of greater guifts: and God ſhall have the greater glorie, to foyl ſuch a warlike Champion with weak and baſe meanes.</p>
            <p>As for my allegations and reaſons which he ſaith, <hi>are the best plea of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Rabbies, &amp;c.</hi> herein he both taxeth me and wrongeth them, me, as if I had bene but their pen man in my former anſwer; them, in ſaying my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are their beſt plee, whereas he hath had neither conference with them, by ſpeeches or writing about theſe matters, ſave onely with Mr Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon. And therefore ſo to ſpeak without triall, bewrayes but the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his ſpirit againſt them. Thus Mr Smyth preparing way for his great challendge, by pretending mine inſufficiencie, calles forth the Rabbies (as he termes them) to ſpeak, challendging the whol Separation to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: wheras a wiſe man would haue ſpared ſuch ſpeaches vntil he had ſeen the iſſue of his combate, already attempted: and not thus to provoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, until he had greater likelihood of victorie. As for thoſe reverend men whom now he calles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for better, <hi>if they can ſay better,</hi> they haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſayd and written ſo much againſt his errors, as I am aſſured he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to anſwer, and when it pleaſeth him to reply, (if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) I doubt not but as they have done, ſo the Lord will inable them to batter downe with ſpiritual weapons, his greateſt forces, that he ſhalbe able to raiſe againſt the truth.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr Smyth ſeemeth to inſinuate, that by his anſwering of my reaſons, he hath anſwered theirs, herein he is deceaved: for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in my former anſwer, (be they what they are,) I acknowledge for mine own, (though written unto him without any purpoſe of publiſhing) if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weaknes be found in them, let it be imputed vnto me, and neither to our Teachers, (who had no hand in ſetting downe thereof) nor yet to the truth it ſelf. As for his challenging of the whole Separation, and other his intemperate ſpeaches in his epiſtle, they bewray in him a malicious hart

            <p>I pray you Mr. Smyth, wherein hath the ſeparation offended you, or my wiſe wronged you, that you deſyre rather to quarrel with them, then with other Churches holding the ſame truth in this thing, agaynſt you? To the Elders and brethren were you moſt welcome, and glad they were of you, ſo long as you walked in the fayth with them. Why is it that you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e become their adverſary? is it becauſe they have rejected you, and your company for your errors, which you wilfully mayntayne? Alas, they muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o it, vnles they would become vnfaythful to God.</p>
            <p>Next after this Chalendge, Mr. Smyth chargeth the ſeparation with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Seing there can be no baptiſing of infants, where there are not firſt Elder people, with whome they come vnder the covenant of God 2. Baptiſm is an other thing divers from the Church, Ephe. 4. 4. 5. and it maketh none to be the people of God, onely it ſealeth vp to be his people, them that are ſo formerly by vertue of his covenant. 3.

Then circumciſion ſhould have made the Sichemites a true Church (for that which baptiſm can doe now in conſtituting of a Church, circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could do then) wherfore I ſay, baptiſm is an ordinance of Chriſt geven to his Church to ſeale vp his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to his people: but is not that whol eſſential conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. And
<pb facs="tcp:23838:6"/> therefore our baptizing of infants (if it were admitted to be vnlawful) can not make the conſtitution of our Church to be falſe, much les being the commaundement of the Lord, can it ſo doo.

We are commaunded to forſake the whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Babylon, Apoc. 18. 4. but not to ſeperate from any ordinance of Chriſt that is found therein, ſave onely from the polutions thereof. Yea Mr. Smyth cannot deny, that a Church ſtanding in Apoſtaſy, is to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, when the baptiſm therein received (if it be of ſuch as confeſſe their fayth and ſins) is ſtill to be retayned, for ſuch baptiſm, (ſayth he) <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore to compare theſe infants with vnreaſonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creatures, as touching the participation of Baptiſme, argueth the authour of ſuch compariſons, to be void of ſpiritual ſenſe and reaſon, and more to follow the corruption of his own hart in hatred againſt the truth, then to mind what he affirmeth.</p>
            <p>Concerning his deſcription of Baptiſme and thoſe Scriptures which he quoteth for proof thereof, ſee them anſwered hereafter, pag. 94. where I have ſhewed, 1. that the baptiſme of the Spirit, is no part of that outward Ceremonie of baptiſme that is adminiſtred by man, but is the inward work of the ſpirit in the elect of God. 2. That the confeſſion of faith &amp; of ſinns, is no part of the Sacrament of Baptiſme: ſeing the confeſſion of ſinns, is ſo often to be repeated, as we tranſgreſſe againſt the Lord, &amp; likewiſe of faith, as we have occaſion adminiſtred vnto us. And therefore baptiſme, which is given to be the ſeale of Gods covenant to his Church, is the baptiſing of the faithful and their ſeed with water, into the name of the father, and of the ſonne and of the holy Ghoſt. Mat. 3. 11. with Mat. 28. 19. &amp; of this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are capable.
<pb facs="tcp:23838:7"/> neyther is their baptiſme <hi>folly,</hi> (as Mr Smyth ſayth) but it wil prove his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make mans confeſsion a part of the Sacrament, which oftentymes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hypocrical, (as it was in S. Magus) &amp; to ſhut out of Gods covenant who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Lord hath accepted. And it wil prove his folly to denye baptiſme to infants, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not performe ſuch actions, as in other reſpects are required of the elder ſort that are to be baptiſed, who alſo not having tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed in like manner, therefore need not ſo to confeſſe. And it wil prove his folly, to deny that an infant can be baptiſed with the ſpirit: for ſo to ſay, is to deny, that an infant can be ſaved. But of theſe things hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>His 2. Reaſon is taken from Iohns baptiſme, framed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohns baptiſme was the baptiſme of repentance. Infants have not Repentance, and therefore can not have the baptiſme of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Argument I anſwer thus, 1. That repentance is required of ſuch as have actually tranſgreſſed, not as the proper cauſe of baptiſme, but as a neceſſarie fruit of fayth, &amp; condition of the Goſpel required of them, that being of yeares are to be received into the church: whether before or ſince Chriſts coming. But of the infants of the faythful, whether of thoſe that are newly received into the church, or of beleevers borne in the church, it is not ſo. Ergo &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Repentance was not required of the infants of the Iewes before they were circumciſed: no more is it to be required of our infants before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, theſe two Sacraments being the ſame in uſe.</p>
            <p>3. If <hi>Baptiſme of repentance,</hi> be underſtood onely of the tyme paſt, &amp; not of the tyme to come, then is that a falſe expoſition of Iohns baptiſme. For as he taught that thoſe that came to be baptiſed ſhould repent: ſo alſo his baptiſme did preach a continual dying to ſinne, or practiſe of repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al our life long, Rom. 6. 4. And therefore though children cannot repent of actual ſinne, which they are not to do, they having not committed the ſame: yet is their baptiſme the baptiſme of repentance: ſeeing it preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continual mortification &amp; repentance to the receivers thereof, which is one true uſe of baptiſme.</p>
            <p>His third reaſon is from the teſtimonie of Tertullian &amp; Euſebius. The words of Tertullian, (as Mr, Sm. himſelf hath engliſhed them) are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therfore to deferre &amp; not to haſten baptiſme, is more profitable for the condition diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition &amp; age of every perſon, but eſpecially as concerning yong children, for what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Rom. 12, 7. 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Acts. 13, 1, 2. Revel. 1, 20. Nehem, 8, 1, - 8. Mat. 23, 2. Mal, 2, 7. Act. 14. 23. And practiſe of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive churches. And of this Miniſterie of Paſtors and Teachers M. Smyth himſelf approveth in his Principles, pag. 18. and in his Queſtions, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, pag. 8. printed this laſt year, 1609. he deſcribing the officers of the Church, devides them, firſt into Biſhops and Deacons, then the Biſhops into Paſtors, or Teachers, or Elders, and withal deſcribeth the Paſtor, to be a biſhop over one particular Church, excelling in the word of wiſdome. The Teacher, to be a Biſhop over one particular church, excelling in the word of knowledge. The Governour, to be a Biſhop of one particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, excelling in wiſe government. Thus hath he written: and yet we having no other Miniſterie, then he himſelf approveth, chargeth us to have a falſe Miniſterie, not caring to croſſe himſelf, ſo he may utter his bitternes againſt the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The 3. corruption this adverſarie chargeth us withal, is, <hi>falſe worſhip of reading books.</hi> This he ſayth, but proves it not.

            <p>What Mr. Smyth can fault in this or in any other of our practiſes, he may at his leaſure diſcover the ſame, if he be not already ſatiſfied.</p>
            <p>Now beſides theſe falſe imputations, it pleaſeth Mr. Smyth to vtter agaynſt this Church many vncharitable and reprochfull ſpeeches: wiſhing alſo, <hi>As the Tirant wiſhed concerning the people of Rome, that all theire heades were joyned into one &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>To paſſe by his tart and bitter ſpeeches unbeſeeming a profeſſor of the Goſpell, concerning his wiſh, I do certifie him thus much, that if it were granted, that the Separation had but one head, his woodden ſword of mans doctrine, wil never be able to ſmyte it of.

            <p>But concerning the Magiſtracy, Mr. Smyth bewrayeth his vnſoundnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> theſe words, <hi>But of Magiſtrates converted to the faith and admitted into the Church by baptiſm, there may questions be made, which to anſwere we cannot if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ld, when ſuch things fall out, the Lord we doubt not will direct vs into the truth concerrning that matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here let the Reader obſerve how they plead ignorance in the matter of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, if ſo they thought of his Authoritie, that he being of the Church, was to beare the ſword, and them of the Church to obey him, as having civill power over them, and whome he might commaund in defence of Religion, &amp; of his country to take vp armes; then needed not he thus to ſpeake. For by his words they geve vs to conjecture, that they think more may be yeelded to an heathen Ruler, then to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. If they be cleare in this pointe, they may ſo explane their myndes. Alſo in this pleading ignorance of the Magiſtracy, they ſeeme to tax the new Teſtament, not to be ſo playne, as Mr Smyth affirmeth, where
<pb facs="tcp:23838:10"/> he ſayth, <hi>All the ordinances of the new Teſtament are plainely taught by C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> his diſciples.</hi> Character, pag. 34. Now if all things be taught in the new Teſtament, why then can he not anſwere thoſe many queſtions that may be made about the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, or why looks he for new direction? wel: this I perceave, that eyther he muſt deny the authority of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, or be driven to confeſſe that the writings of the Apoſtles are not playne enough to diſcribe his office and Authoritie, without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old Teſtament, from which if it be lawfull to reaſon concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter of the Magiſtracy, then I hope it cannot be denyed, but ſo it is lawfull to do, for other ordinances alſo.</p>
            <p>Touching the error of the Incarnation of Chriſt, which alſo Mr. Smyth deſyreth may not be imputed vnto them. It is wel knowne that many of theire company holding that error about the incarnation, are ſeparated from the reſt. And Mr. Smyth him ſelfe (as ſome amongſt them have reported) maketh a queſtion about the firſt matter of Chriſts humane nature as if it were not a poynt of fayth to beleeve that it was of the virgin, though it be to be beleeved that the ſecond matter was nouriſhed in her womb. Whether his hearers do wrong him in ſuch reports, or how he reſteth ſatiſfied, it is beſt knowen to himſelfe. And be it, that he ſtand cleere of this error, yet is be taynted with the errors of general redemption and free wil, els why hath he given forth theſe Poſitions? 1. <hi>Christs Redemption ſtrecheth to all men. 2. Man hath not loſt the facultie of willing any good thing that is ſhewed him.</hi> And with all added therevnto his Reaſons in defence thereof.</p>
            <p>Now let the Reader judge what cauſe he had to deſire, that theſe things ſhould not be imputed vnto them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Mr. Smyth taketh upon him to advertiſe our Church, ſaying: <hi>Let the Separation be advertiſed, that whereas they do ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently through theire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, &amp; ſelf conceat, fil their mouthes with hereſie and hereticks, as therby they would feare Babes, that therein they tread in the steps of all the Antichriſtians their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsors &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this his advertiſment, if any have ſpoken otherwiſe then is meete, I am no Patrone of any ſuch ſpeeches, but if it was lawful for Iohn to call the Phariſeis <hi>Generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vipers,</hi> And Paul to ſay to Elimas, <hi>Oh ful of ſubtilty &amp; all miſcheiffe &amp;c.</hi> then is it not ſimply vnlawfull, to vſe ſuch ſpeeches, ſo it be for reproofe, and not for reproche. Therefore to call them hereticks and
<pb facs="tcp:23838:10"/> their opinions hereſies, (it being true and ſpoken in deteſtation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, not of their perſons;) I ſee no evil in ſo ſaying, ſee theſe places.

               <p>For Anſwer herevnto, know you Sir, and let all men take notice that the thing which you charge me with is moſt vntrue, for preſently after you were fallen into theſe groſſe errors, came <hi>Mr Southworth</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was the ſubſtance of my ſpeaches to Mr Southworth and Mr Bromehead, and of theirs to me.

               <p>2. You charge me with perverting of this ſcripture, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and ſay, that <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Further you ſay, it will not helpe me that <hi>theſe two truthes have bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereſie by the Churches in all ages, for if the Apoſtles affoard contrary to the ſucceeding ages that which is moſt auncient is the truth:</hi> I graunt if you can prove, that the Apoſtles age affoards contrary to the ſucceeding ages for the iuſtifieng of theſe your opinions that then you have good warrant of your ſyde for calling them truthes: but if the Churches which have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned your poſitions for error, have agreed herein with the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then I ſay, the brand of hereſie lies iuſtly vpon them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you alledge <hi>that many truthes wherevnto we are come, have bene condemned for heretical, in as many ages as thoſe truthes which you defend:</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:23838:14"/> I anſwer that not many truthes, if any which we hold, to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance have bene condemned in the ancient Churches for hereſies. And ſuppoſe thoſe Churches did fayle in ſome things, (as every Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to erre, yet followes it not, that therfore they erred in condemning your opinions for haereſie: ſome things I think you wil graunt are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which thoſe ancient Churches ſucceeding the Apoſtles age did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, as thoſe of Arius, Eutiches, Macedonius, and the reſt: and then is not their iudgement ſo lightly to be paſſed over, that no reconing is to be made of what they have done agreable to the ſcriptures. As for your errors we reject them not onely becauſe the ancient Churches have ſo cenſured them, but finding them contrary to the word of God, therfore we condemne them.</p>
               <p>3. Whereas I did feare your broaching of theſe and your former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, would be offenſive, and to the hindering of the truth, this you paſſe over in preſuming of the goodnes of your cauſe, ſaying, <hi>if any be hindred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth, it wil be their ſinne, but if you feare</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that your Antichristian Church will fall to the ground, I ſay, it is that which is appointed to perdition, and to perdition let it go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed if any be hindered from the truth, by the publiſhing of the truth, it is their ſinne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6. but if you which haue ſtood for the truth, ſhall now by publiſhing of error, cauſe the truth to be the more blaſphemed, &amp; give offence to weak profeſſors, that is your ſinne, and wilbe too heavie to be anſwered at the judgement day; if you repent not.</p>
               <p>And as for our Church which you blaſphemouſly call <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> know you that I do not feare the fall of it, for it is built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2, 20. which hath a ſure promiſe that the gates of hel ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayle againſt it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. And therefore your <hi>Anathema</hi> cannot hurt vs, but ſhall rebound back agayn whence it came.</p>
               <p>4. You ſay, <hi>though I haue profeſſed to forſake myne errors vpon their diſcovery, and as I have practiſed, for which I am reproached among your brethren, yet I never profeeſsed my readines to be perverted from the truth, which you call hereſie, and therfore if you did vndertake to write vpon this ground, you might well haue spared your paines and ſaved your ſelf from ſo grevous a ſinne, by pleading for Antichriſtian corruptions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>

               <speaker>Rich: Clifton.</speaker>
               <p>I ſayd that Auxentius the Arrian was one of the firſt that denyed the baptiſme of infants, and then Pelagius, whom Auguſtine and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed and condemned for hereſie: and you anſwer thus, <hi>that one heretike condemned another, contrarie to the ſcripture for the truth ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Auguſtine was an heretick and condemned Auxentius for the truth contrary to the Scripture reſteth for you to prove if you can. I have already proved that the denying of Baptiſme to Infants, is an error, &amp; you have not in all this your writing confuted the ſame as wil appeare in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And here let it be obſerved that you acknowledge Auxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius &amp; Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us to be hereticks, &amp; ſo theſe your errors to have bene firſt broched by men iuſtly condemned for hereſie, for you ſay, <hi>one heretick condemned another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further concerning the fathers by me alleadged in the 6. page of my writing, to ſhew the practiſe of Churches in baptiſing of Infants, you paſſe them over with this anſwer, ſaying, <hi>I can prove that Auguſtine, Cyrill, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Origine, Nazianzene, Ambroſe and many others were as groſse hereticks, (if he be an heretick that holdeth an hereſie) as Auxentius and Pelagius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That theſe Fathers and others had their errors we do not deny, but that they were hereticks, and ſuch as did obſtinately defend their errors, being convinced therof by the word of God, is more I think, then you can prove: we do not ſay that the holding of every error makes an heretick: but when

                     <p>The Major can not be denyed, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. 11. 12.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is likewiſe as true, for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39 ſayth, the promiſe is made to you and to your children, and to all that are a farre off, as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. In which words it plainly appeareth that this is the very ſame covenant and promiſe that was made to Abraham, which they that were a far of, that is the Gentiles beleeving, doe receive and were baptiſed into. And therfore is Abraham called the Father of many nations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 4. alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. 14. Chriſt is ſayd to redeme vs from the curſe of the Law, that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Ieſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit, ſee verſ. 8. 9. Now then if we be partakers of the ſame covenant, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ABRAHAMS covenaunt ſhould not be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. ſeing his poſterity after the fleſh is cut off for a tyme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15. 17. 20.) it muſt follow that the ſame muſt be ſealed to vs, and to our infants, (els it is not the ſame) &amp; that by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God. For the aboliſhing of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the bringing in of baptiſme vnder the goſpell, doth not abrogate or diſannul the commaundement of ſealing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venaunt to the beleeving parents with their infants, which was once commaunded to Abraham, but onely sheweth a changing of the outward ſigne.

But here it is well to be minded if theſe two Teſtaments be not one and the ſame, &amp; be ſayd to be two in reſpect of the tymes and diverſe adminiſtration thereof, and then your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall covenant cannot ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Certaynly the Lord made one eternal &amp; vnchangable covenant to his Church, inſtructing and diſpenſing his benefites otherwiſe in the time of the Law, then now he doth under the Goſpel. And in this reſpect, the Scripture ſpeaking of one and the ſame covenant ot Teſtament, may well ſpeak in regard of the diſpenſation therof, as of two. And ſo underſtand by the old Teſtament, that ſpiritual doctrine of grace delivered by Moſes &amp; the Prophets to the Fathers promiſing eternal life, openly under condition of perfect obedience of the Law, &amp; threatning of the curſe if they did not perform it; together with that intollerable burden of legal rites, &amp; yoke of Moſes politie: and covertly, under condition of repentance &amp; fayth in the Mesſiah to come, prefigured under types, ſhadowes, &amp; ceremonies: that by this meanes the Iewes as by a Schoolmaſter might be lead unto Chriſt. And by the new Teſtament underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſame ſpiritual doctrine of grace now revealed by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, manifeſtly, without ſhadowes and legal rites, promiſing righteouſnes &amp; life to al, both Iewes &amp; Gentils that ſhal beleeve in Chriſt already come.</p>
                     <p>And this being the meaning of the Apoſtle in ſpeaking of two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this place, this ſcripture ſerves nothing for your carnal covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeing both theſe Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are ſpiritual; &amp; though ſome carnal things wer commaunded in the old teſtament: Yet thoſe makes it no more a carnall covenant, then water in Baptiſme, &amp; bread &amp; wine in the Lords ſupper, &amp; the receiving of them (which al are carnal things) do make the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment carnall, they being given to ſignifie vnto us ſpiritual things as were

                     <p>Your ſecond reaſon, <hi>becauſe the beleevers do not occupy Abrahams place in the covenant of the new Testament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, they do thus occupy the place of Abraham, that as he did, ſo<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39</note> do * they receive the covenant to them, and their children, who through the free promiſe of God received by the faith of the parents, have entrance into the covenant together with them: and in this regard parents are, &amp; ſo may be called “fathers of their children, being the meanes whereby they<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39</note> come to this prerogative, And this is not to ſupply that particular of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams fatherhood, which was extraordinarie.</p>
                     <p>Your third reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the infants of the faithful doe not poſseſſe the place of the true children of Abraham, but poſseſse the place of the typical children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham according to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, how the infants of the faithful are the children of Abraham, I have ſhewed, &amp; here, deny that the children of Abraham according to the fleſh onely as you mean, were types of the infants of the faithfull; ſeing the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Proſelytes were the children of the faithful: and they were not the ſeed of Abraham according to the fleſh, yea ſome infants circumciſed, ſhould be types, (as the carnal ſeed of Abraham) and other infants circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Here alſo out of your anſwer you ſet downe five arguments againſt Poedobaptiſtrie.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>If all the carnall infants of Abraham were never actually under the everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in respect of the actuall poſſeſsion of it, then they never had title to the ſeale of the everlaſting covenant. But all the carnall infants were never actually vnder the everlaſting covenant in reſpect of the actuall poſſeſſion of it, ſeing Abrahams children according to his actuall faith were onely under it.

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, unto the major, that to be under the everlaſting covenant, is to be conſidered two wayes, 1. according to the Lords externall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thereof, who of his free grace “maketh his everlaſting covenant<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39</note> with the faithful and their ſeed. 2. according to Gods ſecret election; in the former ſenſe, all the carnall infants of Abraham were, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the faithful are, under the covenant. * For if the root be holy, ſo<note place="margin">Rom. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But thus to vnderſtand, to be vnder the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all poſſeſsion of it, as it is proper onely to the true children of Abraham, ſo the certaine knowledge thereof <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> belongs onely to God. And thus you ſee the majors conſequent, in a right underſtanding of the covenant doth not follow.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond is this, <hi>If Baptiſme doth not ſucceed circumciſion, then Baptiſme doth not perteyne to carnall infants. But Baptiſme doth not ſucceed Circumciſion, becauſe the ſeale of the ſpirit is correſpondent to the typicall ſeale of the fleſh, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with water is onely the manifeſtation of the ſeale. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſequent of the major of this argument is not neceſſarily true, for though baptiſme ſhould not ſucceed circumciſion, yet may it pertayne to the naturall children of beleevers by vertue of the commandement of God. But I deny the minor, and do affirme that Baptiſme doth ſucceed circumciſion, as I have formerly proved. The reaſon of your aſſumption is alſo before diſproved, for the ſpirit as you vnderſtand it, for our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is not correſpondent to circumciſion, ſeing infants are excluded.</p>
                     <p>Your third is this, <hi>If circumciſion did not ſeale vp the everlaſting covenant to Abraham and all his carnall infants (then by your proportion) baptiſme doth not ſeale up the everlaſting covenant to the faithful &amp; their carnal infants. But circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not ſeale vp the everlasting covenant to Abraham and all his carnall infants. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is falſe being rightly vnderſtood, viz: in reſpect of their outward ſtanding; and the contrarie is proved before, to wit, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did ſeale up viſibly the everlaſting covenant to Abraham and all his ſeed. Gen. 17. 7. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Your fourth is this, <hi>If beleeving Parents do not ſtand in Abrahams roome to conveigh the covenant to their infants, then though they be baptiſed themſelves yet their children ſhall not. But the beleevers do not ſtand in Abrahams rowme to conveigh the covenant to their infants, for no man is the father of the faithfull, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was, and he did never conveigh the everlaſting covenant to his carnall infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For conveighing of the everlaſting covenant, this is that which we ſay, that it is conveighed to the children, by the free grace and diſpoſing of the Lord, who giveth his covenant both to the beleevers and to their ſeed,</p>

                  <p>They that are of the kingdome of God have right and title to all the holy things thereto belonging, and may participate of ſo many of them as they are capable to receive.</p>
                  <p>But the infants of beleeving pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are of the kingdom of God. Therefore the infants of beleeving parents have right and title to all the holy things thereto belonging, and may participate of ſo many of them as they are capable to receive and conſequently of baptiſme, ſeing they are capable of it.</p>
                  <p>The major Propoſition I think will not be denyed, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, 1 Cor. 3, 21. 22. All things are yours, Rom. 9. 4.</p>
                  <p>The aſſumption is Mat. 19. 13.—17. For of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, meaning that his kingdome ſtood not onely of ſuch as being of yeares that beleeved, but alſo of their infants. And this he declareth not onely in this ſaying, but alſo by his diſpleaſure againſt his Diſciples for hindering their comming unto him: alſo by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding to ſuffer them to come, and by putting his hands vpon them, and bleſſing them. Mat. 19. 13. 14. 15. For would Chriſt have bleſſed them that were not of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23838:35"/> his kingdome? or do not the bleſſings apperteyne onely to the children of the kingdom, even to the ſeed of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gal. 3. 8. 18.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected that children are not capable of baptiſme, I anſwer, they are as capable thereof, as the infants of Iſrael were of circumciſion, being both partakers of the ſame promiſes with them, and in all reſpects as capable of the outward ſeales of the covenant as they were. And therefore the infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are to be baptiſed.</p>

                     <p>For whom Chriſt prayed, they were of his everlaſting covenant, for he prayed for them <note n="¶" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 10. 20.</note> which were given him, and not for the world.</p>

                     <p>But Chriſt bleſſeth theſe infants: Mar. 10. 16.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Chriſt bleſſeth them with the bleſſing of Abraham, and ſo conſequently theſe infants were capable of baptiſme, becauſe the Lord hath
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23838:38"/> ioyned together the bleſſing or covenant, and the ſigne or ſeale thereof, as before hath bene ſhewed.</p>

Out of this your anſwer you col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect 5 arguments againſt Paedobaptiſtry, the firſt is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They that are not members of the viſible Church, have no title to the holy things of God, and therefore are vncapable of them: and ſo of baptiſme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Infantes of the faythful are not actually members of the viſible Church: for theſe places Marc. 10. 13. 14. Mat. 19. 13. 14. do not prove that the parents of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes were beleeving Iewes, or if they were beleevers their infantes were already bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with their parents according to your doctrine, and ſo Chriſt cannot intend baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to appertayne to them, but the reſt of the ordinances. Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deny the minor, the reaſon proves it not, &amp; do affirm, that the infants of the faythful are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the ſame Church with their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; have right to the holy things therof; as may thus be ſhewed: firſt Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s houſe was a viſible Church of God, the infantes of Abraham and of his ſervantes are<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13. 14. I have ſhewed before what I thought of them. <hi>But if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>re baptiſed,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Christ cannot intend baptiſme vnto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who labours to prove that Chriſt in bleſſing them did intend Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vnto them. This I ſayd that ſuch as are of the Kingdome of God, and capable of the bleſſing of Chriſt are not to be denyed baptiſme. And that infantes are ſuch, I have proved from theſe ſcriptures. Marc. 10. 13. 14. Mat. 19. 13. 14. And therefore baptiſme not to be denyed them.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>If the Apoſtles by putting back infantes preſented to Chriſt declare playnely that infants were not to be brought to be baptiſed by Christ the infantes were not to be baptiſed by Chriſt nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to be baptiſed by him. But the firſt is true, Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The aſſumption is denyed, for if the children were not brought to be baptiſed, how can the Apoſtles putting them back ſignifie that infants are not to be baptized? the bringers of them did expreſſe their mind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they brought them.

                  <p>1 Cor. 7. 14. If the children of beleeving parents be holy, then are they within the covenant of Abraham, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have right to the ſeale thereof.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt is true, 1 Cor. 7. 14. Ergo, the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Touching the former propoſition. I take it, that none will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme holynes in any that are not of the covenant, for in that reſpect Iſrael was called an holy nation. Exod. 19. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 9. and all others vncleane, Act. 11. 3. and 10. 15. that were without. If infants be within the covenant, then cannot the ſeale be denyed to ſuch, ſeing the Lord hath joyned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſeale together, Gen. 17. 10. which no man may or ought to ſeparate, Mat. 19. 6.</p>
                  <p>What can be objected againſt the aſſumption, I ſee not, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle playnly affirmes; <hi>but now are your children ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Vnleſſe it may be ſayd, as of ſome I have heard, that as the vnbeleeving wife is ſanctified to the husband, ſo are the children viz: to the uſe of their Father: but this to affirme is a great abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſcripture. For the Apoſtle in that place anſwering an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23838:41"/> obiection that the faithfull is defiled by the ſocietie of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful: proveth that the faithful husband may with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience uſe the veſſel of his unfaithful wife, by an Argument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the effects, namely, becauſe their children, which are borne of them, are accounted holy, or within the promiſe, God having ſayd to all the faithful, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed. As for that other ſtrange expoſition, that the Children of a beleeving father are no otherwiſe ſanctified the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the unbeleeving wife is unto her husband, viz: to their fathers uſe onely, that can not ſtand with the meaning &amp; purpoſe of the Apoſtle. For ſo much may be ſayd of an unbeleeving ſervant, that he is for the vſe of his maſter to do him ſervice: if children be no more holy then ſo, then have they no prerogative in being the children of a beleeving Father, neither is the objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> removed by this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>If it be further preſſed that the unbeleeving wife is ſayd to be holy, as well as the children, yet is ſhe not within the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. I anſwer that ſhe indeed is not holy, as be her children, for ſhe being an infidel is without Gods covenant, and therefore ſhe is ſayd to be ſanctified to her husband, the Apoſtle reſpecting their mariage, which though it was contracted before eyther party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, yet ſtands firme and not deſolved when eyther of them is called to the faith, ſo that the beleeving husband may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe her as his wife, if ſhe be content to dwel with him, 1 Cor. 7. 12. Now the children cannot be ſanctified or ſeparated to ſuch uſe to their father, as the wife is to her husband.

If the infants of the Iſraelites were baptiſed in the cloud and in the ſea as well as their parents, what letteth the infants of beleeving pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnder the Goſpel to be likewiſe parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of baptiſme as well as they?</p>
                  <p>The former the Apoſtle affirmes 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2. and therefore good warrant muſt be ſhewed that our infants are cut off from this priveledge that the Iewes children had.

                  <p>The depriving of our children of the Sacrament, is to ſhorten the Lords bountie towards his people of the new Teſtament; that being denyed to their children which God gave to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to their infants under the law, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. The proportion holdes not, for Man, and water, were not onely given to Iſrael to be to them a ſacrament: but alſo ſerved for their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie corporal food, and ſo is not the bread and wyne in the Lords ſupper.</p>
                     <p>3. If things be compared alike, our ſacraments to their ordinarie ſacraments, no ſuch conſequence can be gathered as you intend: for the infants of Iſrael were circumciſed, but did not eat the paſſeover, until they were able to go to that place which God had appointed for the eating thereof, and to eat it according to the Lords ordinance: and ſo much we wil graunt for the Lords ſupper, that they are to eat it, that can eat it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>4. If infants in partaking of thoſe former Sacraments, were in them partakers of Chr, why ſhal not our infants alſo in the uſe of the ſacrament
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23838:56"/> of baptiſme be held partakers of the things ſignified, ſeeing (as you ſay, thoſe ſacraments were types of ours) the truth muſt be anſwerable to the type.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Againe, I anſwer more properly thus, that there ſhal be a proportion between the type and the truth, that baptiſme of the cloud and the ſea, and our baptiſme. viz, that as yong and old carnal Iſraelites were baptiſed in the cloud and ſea: ſo yong and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>l spiritual Iſraelites ſhal be baptiſed by the baptiſme of repentance &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, I deny that the Iſraelites conſidered as they were accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to partake of the ſacraments were carnal, but <note n="†" place="margin">Ex. 19. 1. Pet. 2.</note> ſpiritual and holy.</p>
                     <p>2. Vnder the type you have yong and old in yeares: ſo if you would keep Proportion muſt be the like under the truth. But this you deny, and make two ſorts of beleevers yong and old. Now I ask you whom you cal yong and old Iſraelites, and if any that beleeves may defer his baptiſme; until he be old in fayth? And if this be <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8. 12. 36. 37 &amp; 9. 18. &amp; 10. 47. 4. &amp; 16. 15. 33.</note> not lawful, and none but young beleevers be baptiſed, how wil your proportion ſtand between the type, &amp; the thing ſignified? 3. Their baptiſme in the cloud and ſea did preach unto them repentance, as wel as our baptiſme doth unto us, and in this there is a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude between them: but that our outward baptiſme, is the truth of that former baptiſme in the ſea and cloud, to the Iſraelites, I deſire it may be proved.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I would know, whom you mean, <hi>by spiritual fathers and their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual children?</hi> Before you called Abraham the father of the faythful and al beleevers his children. But thus to make up a proportion between your type and truth, you are driven to acknowledge other ſpiritual fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Abraham: which being ſo, you muſt grant that they are then ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in reſpect of their children to whom the covenant is conveighed by Gods free grace together with them: For if the children come into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by their own fayth, and enter as did their parents, then are they Abrahams children, not theirs, according as the ſcripture ſpeaketh.

                        <hi>Further I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our infants ſhal have a priviledge far greater then the infants of the Iſraelites had in that tipical baptiſme. For they by it were onely baptiſed into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the law, that by it they might learn Moſes, and in Moſes the truth in Chriſt as it were under a vaile: but our infants under the Gospel ſhal have the daylie inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and education of faithful parents &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle ſayth in 1. Cor. 10. 2. <hi>that al the Iſraelites were baptiſed unto
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23838:57"/> Moſes in the cloud and in the ſea.</hi> But ſayth not as you ſay, <hi>into the law,</hi> thoſe ſacraments were ſeales unto them of the covenant of ſalvation, not of the law, which then was not given. Secondly, to be baptiſed unto Moſes may thus be underſtood, viz. that they were baptiſed, Moſes being their guid, or miniſter by whom they were inſtructed in the wayes of God. Thirdly, the baptiſme of the Iſraelites howſoever it might be typicall in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yet did it ſignifie unto them true things, whereof they were partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.<note place="margin">Deu. 6. 6. &amp; 11. 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover I deny that the baptiſme of the cloud and ſea, was a type of the external baptiſme of the new Testament in the abſtract: but it was a type of our baptiſme in the concrete, that is, the baptiſme of the cloud did type out our baptiſme in the three partes thereof, viz. 1. the baptiſme of the spirit, 2. the declaration of fayth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the antecedent of the baptiſme with water, 3. the outward waſhing with water, a manifestation of the foreſaid particulers &amp;c.</hi>

For as the books of the new Teſtament do plainly declare the fulfilling of all the myſteries of our redemption: ſo do the books of the old Teſtament ſpeak of ſome things more expreſly then the writings of the Apoſtles. But to come to the point. I anſwer, that it was not needful for Chriſt to deſcribe things in ſo large manner, which before had been written, and were ſtil to continue, as example, the ſealing of the covenant, the perſons yong and old that were to be ſigned, and ſuch like, what needs a new repetition hereof, when the Lord purpoſed not to diſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nul them: ſo much as was to be altered, concerning the outward ſigne, Chriſt omitted not to declare. And therefore cannot be accuſed of any unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, if he in expreſſe words had not commanded infants to be baptiſed, ſeing under the old Teſtament they had the ſigne of the covenant.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Apoſtles writings do plainly ynough declare unto us that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to be baptiſed, as both from that commandement of Chriſt, Mat, 28. 19. and the practiſe of the Apoſtles in baptiſing of families, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>And concerning, the tyme of baptiſing, I ſee no reaſon why you ſhould cavil about it, more then about the tyme of adminiſtring the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which Chriſt hath not ſo preciſely ſet down neither the day, nor tyme of the day for the adminiſtring thereof, as Moſes did of the paſſeover.</p>
                     <p>And the ſcriptures which you cite do ſhew that bap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be adminiſtred when men enter into Gods covenant, and children entring in at the ſame tyme with their parents, are to be baptiſed at the ſame tyme with them, as Iſmael and al Abrahams howſe were circumciſed * the ſame day with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.<note place="margin">

And this rule I confeſſe to be obſerved to all ſuch like as are to be received to baptiſme, that they make confeſſion of their fayth &amp; ſinnes as they did: but they ſerve not to teach vs to deale ſo towards their infants or the infants of beleevers that are borne within the covenant. For the condition of them that are to be admitted into the church and of them that are borne in it, is not the ſame as concerning the adminiſtration of baptiſme, no more then it was in the Iewiſh Church towching circumciſion; for the one is declared to come within the covenant by their owne profeſſion; and the other to be within it, by their being borne of beleeving parents: if you had inſtanced an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of one that was borne in the Church of the new teſtament, of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that were members thereof, whoſe baptiſing was differd until he was able to make confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, then had you ſayd more to the purpoſe, though in ſuch an example there might haue bene neglect, as was in Moſes in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing his ſonne.</p>

Concerning the Gaylors wife, their children and ſervants, what letteth that they might not be baptiſed, if they refuſed not the grace of God offered? The Apoſtle preached <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 16. 31. 32.</note> ſalvation to the whole family, and the Gaylor beleeved, and he with all that belonged unto him were baptiſed.

You ſay, to the baptiſme of the Gaylors wife and children of yeres of diſcretion, there was neceſſarily required ſaith and repentance, or els they were not baptiſed: ſo ſay I becauſe infants cannot beleeve and repent, though they were in the family, yet they ſhall not be baptiſed.</hi>

                     <p>2. <hi>I ſay, that although it be ſaid, that all that perteyneth to the Gaylor were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed yet it is alſo ſayd, verſe, 32. that the word was preached to all that were in his houſe. &amp; verſe 34. that all his howſhold beleeved, &amp;c. ſeing therfore all that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Gaylors houſe beleeved by the preaching of the word.

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſcripture ſayth, that Lidia was baptiſed and her houſhold without excepting of any, the like is ſayd of Stephanas familie, 1 Cor. 1. 16.

Gal. 3. 27. 28. &amp; 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 4. 20. &amp; 4. 15. &amp; 5. 18. and in divers others.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Apostles practiſe is our inſtruction, but the Apoſtle in baptiſing howſholds,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23838:61"/> Firſt Preached to all that were in the family, and then they beleeving were baptiſed. Ergo they onely that by the preaching of the word were converted and beleeved were baptiſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This argument might have bene granted, had not the concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned more then the former propoſitions, viz. this word, (<hi>onely</hi>) which ought to have bene placed in the one of them, and if in the aſſumption, then were it falſe to ſay, that onely they that beleeved were baptiſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o more: the places wherevpon this argument is grounded are anſwered before. And it is to be further obſerved, that this was the Apoſtles practiſe to ſuch as were of yeares and not before of the Church. Your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which the Apoſtles practiſed in one family, they practiſed in all families that they baptiſed: But in the Gaylors family according to Chriſts comiſſion, Mat. 28. 19. they firſt made them Diſciples by preaching the word, Act. 16. 32. 34. Ergo. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This argument alſo may be granted, and maketh nothing againſt the baptiſing of infants, except your heretical collection which I deny. And this may ſuffice for reply to your anſwer to this &amp; the reſt of my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>

                  <p>HErevnto I will adioyne ſome teſtimonies of the fathers, not to prove that children ought to be baptiſed, which is to be done, &amp; is by the ſcriptures already proved: but to ſhew the practiſe hereof in auncient Churches. Auguſtine (as I find alledged) writing to Ierome. epiſt. 28. ſayth, <hi>Cyprian not making any new decree. but firmely obſerving the faith of the Church iudged with his fellow Biſhops, that as ſoone as one was borne, he might lawfully be baptiſed.</hi> See Cyprian epiſt. to Fidus. And writing againſt the Donatiſts, lib. 4. cap. 23. &amp; 24. ſayth, <hi>that the baptiſme of infants was not derived from the authoritie of man, neither of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, but from the tradition or doctrine of the Apoſtles.</hi> Ciril, vpon

Origine vpon the Rom. ſayth, <hi>that the Church received baptiſme of infants from the Apoſtles.</hi> Nazianzenus in Orat. in S. Lavacrum. 3. ſayth, <hi>that baptiſme agreeth to everie age, to every condition of life, to all men if thou hast an infant, it is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified from his infancy, yea from the finger ends it is conſecrated.</hi> After he ſayth: <hi>ſome man wil ſay what ſayeſt thou of infants which neither know what grace is nor payne, what ſhal we baptiſe thoſe?</hi> &amp; he anſwers, <hi>yea verily.</hi> Amb. lib. 2. de Abraham cha. 11. Speaking of baptiſme, ſayth, <hi>neyther old man nor Proſelyte, nor infant is to be excepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every age is guilty of ſinne and therefore stands need of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Theſe &amp; many other of the fathers do beare witneſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures of the lawfulnes of the baptiſing of infants.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of antichriſtian hereſies, you tax them very deeply, and you that ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure others, had need to judge your ſelfe, otherwiſe the Lord wil find out a ſentence againſt you.

It is one thing to produce the teſtimony of the fathers witneſſing the truth according to the ſcripture, &amp; another, for the defence of errors: the latter we reiect, &amp; you take vp, but the former we approve and you condemne. And although we are not to build our fayth vpon the fathers; yet for matter of fact done in their tymes we may give credit to their report: and ſo theire teſtimonie ſerves to prove ſomething, namely to ſhew the practiſe of their tymes to which end I did alledge them, and that is not to confeſſe that they prove nothing as you charge me. And ſay <hi>Remember that, and let al men take notice, that you produce testimonies, that you ſay prove nothing.</hi> And I pray you remember with what ſpirit you writ theſe words.</p>

                     <p>That confeſſion was required before the baptiſing of men growne to yeres and newly come to the faith is not denyed, and more then this can not be gathered from Euſebius words as you ſet them downe. But what is this againſt the baptiſing of infants? Howbeit I find not this of Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in Lib. 7. chap. 8. but in that chapter mention is made of <hi>a certayne faithful brother that being preſent when ſome were baptiſed and heard what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and what was anſwered, weeping, &amp;c. began to confeſse that he had otherwiſe received baptiſme of Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> Now if he was baptiſed of Hereticks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confeſſion of his faith, it was contrary to the practiſe of the Church, &amp; of the Apoſtles concerning ſuch as came newly to the faith.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23838:65"/> ſo much, but by concluſion of neceſſarie conſequence from the ſcriptures. And to this purpoſe might divers other inſtances be alledged. So likewiſe if we prove the baptiſing of infants by vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable arguments out of the old and new teſtament, (though wee can not ſhew any playne precept or example) yet may upon warrant thereof, not feare to baptiſe them. For the author of this reaſon himſelfe can not deny, that both he and we muſt beleeve divers things which we gather out of the Scriptures by neceſſary conſequence that we ſhal not find in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, as that there be 3 perſons in one Godhead, that the ſon is <hi>Homouſius,</hi> that is, of the ſame ſubſtance with the father; now ſuch expreſſe words cannot be ſhewed in the ſcripture.

Alſo if this Argument be ſufficient to barr children from the Sacrament of Baptiſme, then is it as ſufficient to keepe back women from the Lords Supper, but the lawfulnes thereof is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by conſequence, becauſe they are within the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and are partakers of the Sacrament of baptiſme.

That there is both precept by Chriſt and example by his Diſciples for the baptiſing of infants as hath bene proved by my two laſt reaſons alledged to prove the lawfulnes of baptiſing of Infants. Commandement I ſay, Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Goe teach al nations baptiſing them,</hi> where is no exception of the Children of faithfull parents. And therefore there being a lawe once geven that the covenant ſhould be ſealed to the infants as well as to the beleving parents, the ſame lawe of ſealing the covenant, muſt ſtand ſtil in force to the parties (though the outward ſigne be changed) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the lawemaker do repeal it, or have ſet downe ſome ground for the repeale thereof, which muſt be ſhewed, or els this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement doth bind vs and our infants to receave this feale of the covenant.</p>

                     <p>And as for examples, we read that the Apoſtle baptiſed Lidia &amp; her houſehold. Act. 16. 15. and the Gayler and al that belonged vnto him verſ. 33. both which ſeming to be great houſholds, it is not likely that they were without children though the Evangeliſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them not. But the exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that only ſuch as did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe their ſins &amp; confeſſe their fayth were baptiſed. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Iohn, he was ſent to call the people to repentance and ſo to prepare the waye of the Lord Mat. 3. 3. and ſo many as did repent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſins, he baptiſed: but did Iohn refuſe their children if they brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> them to him? but it wilbe ſayd there is no mention made that he did baptiſe them: no more ſay I, is there that they were offered unto him. There is no mention that the diſciples of Chriſt were baptiſed, and yet it were too bold a part, and no doubt very falſe, to affirme that they were not baptiſed. All things that Iohn did, nor that Chriſt did in the particulars are written. Ioh. 20. 30. but the ſumme thereof. And therefore to gather an Argument from hence, becauſe there is no mention that children were baptiſed of Iohn, therefore they ought not to be baptiſed, is a larger concluſion then the premiſſes will bear.: and ſo that reaſon taken from the baptiſing of the Eunuch (Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip baptiſed no childen when he baptiſed the Eunuch) is of no weight to prove that therefore children ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Was not the Eunuch a ſtranger farr from his country, now in iourney homeward, &amp; therefore not like that he ſhould have his children with him, ſpecially in ſuch a tedious iourney, &amp; not knowing of this accident.</p>

Againe another part of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be brought into forme thus. That which hath precept and example must be practiſed.

                        <p>Firſt, the Major of your former Sillogiſme is not neceſſarily true, your ſelfe confeſſeth † <hi>that every conſequent neceſsarily deduced from the ſcripture is as wel</hi>

                           <hi>and as truely the word of truth, as that which is in playne termes expreſſed, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore you ought to have added (<hi>nor ground of the ſcripture</hi>) or ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>2. The minor I deny, and haue proved that there is both precept and example for baptiſing of infants. Your ſecond Syllogiſme may be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſave that the concluſion ſeemes to entend more then the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, viz, in theſe words, (<hi>are the perſons to be baptiſed</hi>) as yf onely ſuch (&amp; not infants) as can confeſſe their faith, are to be baptiſed, which I deny.</p>
                        <p>Before you proceed to confirme your argument: you labour firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move my anſwer ſaying. <hi>Although a neceſsary conſequence in all caſes ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, yet I ſay, the Lord can not leave vs in this particular to neceſsary conſequence, he dealing plainely and faithfully with vs &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You graunt a neceſſarie conſequence in all caſes ſhall prevaile, why not in this particular. Your reaſon is, <hi>ſeing the new Teſtament is more manifeſt then the old, &amp;c. and Moſes hath ſet downe distinctly and plainly the perſons with their qualifications to be circumciſed, &amp;c. either Chriſt hath as plainely and fully ſet downe theſe particulars or els the new testament, is not ſo playne as the old.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. By this your reaſon you iniure God &amp; his word, who leaft the Iewes in the books of Moſes onely to conſequences towching that great point of the reſurrection, which yet Chriſt accounted ſufficient, and againſt the Sadduces, drewe his Argument to prove the reſurrection out of Exodus, 3. 6. where no ſuch thing is expreſſely mentioned, and ſo by your doctrine he dealt not plainely and faithfully. Alſo every other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that he or the Apoſtles uſed upon a neceſſarie conſequence can

                           </gap>h your reaſon exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but I wil come to your particular whereof you would have it underſtood, viz, that Chriſt can not deale faithfully, if for the baptiſing of infants he hath not <hi>as playnely deſcribed the ordinance of baptiſme, the perſons with all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Do you thinke that if Chriſt have not ſet downe every circumſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout baptiſme, that he is therefore unfaythful? what think you of his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing of the other Sacrament, where is it ſet downe ſo playnely, that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhalbe partakers thereof? there is no mention that any woman was preſent at Chriſts adminiſtration of his laſt ſupper: where is the tyme ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed for the adminiſtration thereof, as was for the Paſſeover? muſt Chriſt for this be accuſed to have dealt not ſo faithfully as Moſes? had our Saviour any need to teach or write otherwiſe then he hath done about the ſacraments? ſeing it is the ſame covenant under the Goſpel that was ſealed to the old Church, and a commaundement given for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof unrepealed: that which was to be chaunged concerning the outward ceremonie, Chriſt hath plainely ſet it downe with direction for for the adminiſtration thereof. And that which was needful for Moſes in deſcribing circumciſion, was not ſo neceſſarie for Chriſt in deſcribing of baptiſme: becauſe circumciſion was to be adminiſtred onely to the males, but baptiſme to both ſexes, circumciſion on the 8. day: baptiſme is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no ſtrict time, and therefore the particular deſcription of theſe circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might wel be omitted, and no unfaithful dealing in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>As for the minding of it to be adminiſtred to infants, there was no uſe of any ſuch particular direction, ſeing the Lord had once ordeyned to ſeal his covenant to the faithful &amp; their ſeed, &amp; renueth the ſame in a general maner under the Goſpel, which may ſuffice to all that are ſober minded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For it had bene eaſily ſaid, go teach &amp;c. baptiſe them, &amp; if they have any infants baptiſe them, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>It is not for man to preſcribe wiſedome how to ſpeak, things are taught plainly inough, if God give men eares to heare.</p>

                        <p>Whoſoever are Chriſts are Abrahams ſeed &amp; within the covenant.</p>

                        <p>2. The infants of beleevers are eyther of the church, <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 1. 2. 23.</note> which is the body of Chriſt, or without: If within, then are they of the covenant, and Chriſt is theirs, for he <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23838:68"/> your deſire. As for Dorcas being a diſciple, is no expreſſe example, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Iewes were Moſes diſciples, yet were it not true to reaſon, that therefore they were circumciſed. As for Gal. 3. 28. &amp; 1 Cor. 12. 13. they ſpeak of the ſpiritual union in Chriſt, and ſpiritual graſſing into his body by the ſpirit and baptiſme, but neither of them ſayth, let women partake of the Lords ſupper.

                           <hi>Your 3. Anſwer and exception followeth, wherein you do affirme that there is both precept and example for baptiſing of infants &amp;c. to theſe I have already anſwered in the ſixt and ſeventh reaſons going before.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And there alſo may you receve ſatiſfaction to that you have anſwered: but yet to one objection concerning the commandement once given, of the ſealing of infants. <hi>I anſwer</hi> (ſay you) <hi>beſides that baptiſme is not the ſeal of the new Teſtament but the spirit, and that circumciſion was not the ſeal of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant &amp;c. So though it were granted that infants of the old Teſtament were by circumciſion ſealed to the covenant made in Christ, which I peremptorilie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet ſeing the tyme of circumciſion is expired, therefore infants are not to be ſealed by baptiſme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To al this it is anſwered <note n="“" place="margin">pag. 12, 37. 38.</note> before that circumciſion as alſo baptiſme are ſeales of the covenant of ſalvation, and though the tyme of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſing be expired, yet is not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of ſealing of the covenant expired, &amp; therfore infants are ſtil to be ſealed with baptiſme which ſuccedeth circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the laſt place you require proſe that onely perſons that confeſsed their ſinns &amp; their faith were baptiſed, I prove it thus: They onely were to be baptiſed that Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be baptiſed, perſons made diſciples by teaching, were onely commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſed by Chriſt. Mat. 28. 29. Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I deny your Aſſumption, the affirmative is not to baptiſe them onely that are made diſciples by teaching, but alſo their ſeed, as formerly hath been proved: and you feighne a falſe negative to that affirmative, in Mat. 28. 19.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Againe, conſidering that in every affirmative there is included a negative, therefore whereſoever example is, that perſons confeſſing their ſinns and their fayth were baptiſed, there is ſignified that thoſe that did not confeſſe their ſinues &amp;c. were not baptiſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:23838:69"/>
                        <p>This is graunted of ſuch as were of yeares and to be added to the Church; &amp; ſo now to be practiſed towards any of the Turks or ſuch like that ſhould come to the faith. But this is falſe, that becauſe perſons confeſſing their faith were baptiſed, therfore the infants of the faithful, not able to make confeſſion of their faith ſhall not be baptiſed. Willing confeſſing muſt be oppoſed to actuall refuſing, if the argument according to the mind of the holy Ghoſt ſtand good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For we muſt know that the bodie is one &amp;c. and the ſeed one and not two, for in the new Testament they know God from the leaſt to the greateſt. Heb. 8. 11. and they are al taught of God. Mat 11. 11. and this I take to be a playne proofe of the point which you deſire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ſerves rather to prove that children are to be baptiſed becauſe they are of the ſame body of Chriſt. To affirme infants to be baptiſed is not to hold two ſeedes of contrary natures as you charge us, for as the father, ſo are his children partakers of the covenaunt, and both are a holy ſeed &amp; children of God in reſpect thereof, though the father profeſſe his faith &amp; the childe cannot, in reſpect of age. the father can reaſon, ſo cannot his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, yet both of them are of the ſame nature, &amp; reaſonable creatures. And be it that ſome of the children whoſe parents profeſſe the faith are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſo may it be alſo that the father that confeſſeth his faith is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but this belongs not to us: we are to hold them as children of the covenant as the word teacheth.<note place="margin">

                        <p>2.

                        <p>Againe to prove the Diſciples to be baptiſed, you cite Ioh. 4. 1. &amp; 1. 35. 40.

                           <hi>Becauſe Chriſt commaundeth to make Diſciples by teaching them and then to baptiſe them. Mat. 28. 19. Ioh. 4. 1. But infants can not by doctrine become Christs diſciples, and ſo can not by the rule of Christ be baptiſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anſwer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles were indede commanded to make Diſciples and to call vnto the faith and felowſhip of the Goſpel not onely the Iewes, but the Gentiles throughout the world and gave them power to preach the Goſpel, which before had bene preached to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Gal. 3. 8. And to baptiſe all that did receive it. And this we grant that fayth muſt go before baptiſme, in al ſuch as are to be made Diſciples and brought into the covenant of God. So went fayth before circumciſion: Abraham firſt beleeved &amp; after was circumciſed. And likewiſe muſt al they which with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enter into Gods covenant, firſt beleeve and then be baptiſed, as the Eunuch, Act. 8. 37. Lydia Act. 16. 15. &amp; the Keeper of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, verſe. 33. but when ſuch have receved the fayth, then are their infants and houſhold capable alſo of baptiſme, as Abrahams family was of circumciſion, he beleeved the promiſes Gen. 17. &amp; therefore it is written that when God opened the hart of Lidia that ſhee did attend to the word that Paule preached and beleved; not onely ſhe herſelfe, but all her houſehold were baptiſed, and yet is there no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fayth of any of them, ſave of Lidias onely. And ſo the Keeper beleeving, all that appertayned vnto him were baptiſed. And this is proportionable to the example of Abraham, whoſe fayth we find ſufficient to intereſt all his in the covenant, and make them capable of the ſeale.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Chriſt taketh the ſame courſe in giving out his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Diſciples, Mat. 28. 19. to bringe the Gentiles into Gods
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23838:71"/> covenant, that the Lord tooke with Abraham for making his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him that he ſhould be the father of many nations &amp;c. he did not firſt command him to be circumciſed, but preached to him the Goſpel or covenant, and he beleeving was circumciſed and his houſhold: So here is a commandement, firſt for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Goſpel to them that were not in Chriſt: and for baptiſing ſuch as beleeved with their families (for it is included in this commandement, els had not the Apoſtle baptiſed the families of Lidia and of the Keper, as before is obſerved.) And it is wel to be minded that there is no mention made of the faith of any in the familie of Lidia, ſave of Lidias onely, for it is not ſayd all in the houſe that beleeved were baptiſed, which had bene neceſſary if this commandement of Chriſt ſhould be expounded after the mind of the Anabaptiſts.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If children ſhalbe excluded from baptiſme becauſe they can not be made Diſciples by teaching and ſo beleeve, then by as good reaſon may they be excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſalvation, for he that ſayth <hi>he that beleeveth and is baptiſed ſhalbe ſaved,</hi> ſayth alſo, <hi>he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, ſhalbe damned Mar.</hi> 16. 16. if therfore want of fayth be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to exclude infants from baptiſme, then likewiſe the want of faith is ſufficient to exclude them from ſalvation. If the former be held to be the meaning of Chriſt, then muſt alſo the latter be graunted, a thought whereof is to be abhord.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, generall rules muſt be taken with their ſenſe and meaning. It is a generall rule given by the Apoſtle. 2 Theſ. 3 10. <hi>that if any would not work, he ſhould not eate.</hi> Yet if any ſhould gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, that the impotent &amp; infants ſhould not eat, becauſe they do not work, this were to offer violence, &amp; to wreſt the Apoſtles doctrin: So Chriſt giving a general rule for the making of Diſciples and baptiſing them: now to deprive the infants of beleeving parents of baptiſme, becauſe they cannot receive inſtruction (which is intended onely of them that are capable thereof) is to diminiſh the commandement of Chriſt: alike as he that ſhould ſay, <hi>infants
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23838:71"/> can not beleeve, and therefore cannot be ſaved.</hi> Againe, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the true meaning of a ſcripture, when it is ſo expounded, that the expoſition contradicteth other ſcriptures, or any ſound concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gathered out of the Scriptures, as this expoſition of the Anabaptiſts doth upon this place of Mat. 28. 19. as my former reaſons for the baptiſing of infants, do playnely manifeſt.</p>

No (ſayth the Apoſtle) for he received cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. 2. It might be objected, yet it ſeemeth that he received cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in vayn, ſeing he had received the righteouſnes of fayth before: no (ſayth Paul) for he received it as a ſeal for the confirmation of his fayth which he had in his uncircumciſion. Then he expreſſeth the cauſe both of Abrahams juſtification by fayth, when he was uncircumciſed, and alſo that being juſtified by fayth he received circumciſion, viz. <hi>that he might be the father of al that beleeve being uncircumciſed, that righteouſnes might be imputed unto them alſo, And the father of circumciſion, not unto them onely which are of the circumciſion, but alſo unto them that walk in the steps of the fayth of our father Abraham: &amp;c.</hi> this is the Apoſtles meaning.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas you affirme, <hi>that circumciſion upon Abraham was a ſeal of iustification to al the uncircumciſed that beleeve,</hi> I deſire this may be proved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you mean. For the Apoſtle ſayth it not, but thus, <hi>he received the ſigne of circumciſion the ſeal of the righteouſnes of the fayth which he had:</hi> for how could Abrahams circumciſion that was applied to his particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeal up juſtification to us &amp; not to himſelf? ſeeing a ſeal is a particular applying of the covenant to the partie that is partaker thereof. By this your expoſition, you make Abrahams circumciſion to differ from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of his ſeed, of which difference, the Lord ſpake not a word in the inſtitution thereof, nor in any other place. Yet you ſay, <hi>the righteouſnes of fayth is not ſealed up to Abrahams particular perſon, but to the uncircumciſed that beleeve.</hi> Which doctrine is very ſtrange, that Abrahams circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhal ſeal that to others &amp; thoſe uncircumciſed, &amp; not to himſelf being circumciſed, you muſt therefore bring better proofe hereof, els your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

                           <hi>I anſwere, that in this particular there are differences betwixt the one act of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the other of Lydia and the Gaylor according to the commiſſion of Christ, Mat. 28. 19. 1. Abraham and all his family by the Lords commaundement came under the covenant of the old Testament actually, &amp; the males onely were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but Chriſt doth not commaund all perſons of a family in the new teſtament to be baptiſed, but onely ſuch as are made diſciples. 2. the Goſpel was onely preached to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams owne perſon, but in the Gaylors caſe Paul preached to all that were in his houſe, &amp;c. 3. The goſpel was not preached to Abraham thereby to prepare him to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as if thereby it ſhould follow, that circumciſion was a ſeal of the Goſpel, for it is not ſo, &amp;c. but Christ in the new teſtament commaundeth the gospel to be preached to every parricular perſon, that is to be admitted into the Church by baptiſme, and ſo Paul did to the Gaylors family.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To your firſt difference I anſwer as formerly I haue done, that Abraham and his family came not under the old teſtament or covenant of works, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not made with him but with Iſrael afterward by the Miniſtery of Moſes. 2. Your compariſon ſhould thus be propounded: as Abraham &amp; all his family, came under the covenaunt of God: ſo likewiſe do the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Gentiles and their families: &amp; therefore as Abraham and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were circumciſed: ſo ought the faithful and their families to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thus holds the compariſon, and thus it is againſt you: and you do but beg the queſtion, in ſaying, that Chriſt commaunds not all the perſons of of a family in the new Teſtament to be baptiſed: for this is defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; that Chriſts commaundement of baptiſing, extends to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the beleevers as wel as to themſelves.</p>
                        <p>To your 2. difference I anſwer, that the Goſpel which was by the Lord preached to Abraham, was by <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To my 3. exception thus you anſwere: <hi>Chriſt ſpeakes onely of ſuch as to whom the goſpel may be preached that are of a docible age and nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I graunt that Chriſt intendeth by his commaundement that they ſhould be taught, that are of a docible age, but with all intendeth it ſo to be preached to them, as it was before to Abraham, which was not to exclude their infants from the covenant or ſeale thereof. To this obiection, how infants not being in the covenaunt can be ſaved, you anſwere: <hi>Eyther they are all ſaved though they can not come to faith by hearing, or that they are one of the Lords ſecrets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Can you ſpeak of faith, to ſay they are all ſaved and not within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace? but it is not your faith, for you hold it doubtingly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven to a non plus, you anſwer as the Preiſts and Elders did to Chriſt concerning Iohns baptiſme, who ſayd, wee can not tell whether it be from heaven or of men: and ſo you make the ſtate of children, one of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, but the contrarie I have before proved. And here you might ſee (if your erronious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not blynded your eyes,) that you cannot beleev that any infants ſhalbe ſaved, ſeing by your doctrine you haue no word to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your faith upon for their ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>To the laſt particular of my anſwer, you reply, ſaying:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt, you confeſſe that this place of Mat. 28. 19. is not vttered of Christ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of infants that they ſhould be taught, and then I ſay, he never intended by this place that they ſhould be baptiſed, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe as much as I haue ſpoken: In this ſcripture: Mat. 28. 19. Chriſt commaunded to make diſciples and to baptiſe them, the former I ſayd, Chriſt intended to ſuch as were unconverted, but yet ſo, as they receiving the goſpel, their infants came alſo under the covenant: the latter, I did, and ſtil do affirme to be vnderſtood of the beleevers and their ſeed, and ſo I have not contradicted my ſelf, as you untruly ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Next I ſay, that general rules ſhalbe expounded with their ſenſes, and as impotent perſons &amp; infants ſhal eat, though they can not work: ſo infants ſhall be ſaved, though they cannot be baptiſed, ſeing they cannot by teaching be made Diſciples &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now you affirme infants ſhalbe ſaved, a little before you doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23838:75"/> it were not a ſecret, thus vnſtable men are when they erre from the truth. But if infants can be ſaved as now you affirme, then tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you hold them to be ſaved in the covenant or out of the covenant? if within, you croſſe your ſelf, and if without, ſhew me what warrant out of the word you haue ſo to beleeve? certainely <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> there is no ſalvation out of Chriſt. And if children can be ſaved by the covenant, why is the ſigne thereof denied them?

                        <p>Your concluſion of this argument, is ſhut up with ſome bitter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſpeeches: ſaying: <hi>You blaspheme the truth with your title of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtry.

                        <p>Anſwer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This reaſon ſemeth to imply, that the ſeed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is part carnal and part ſpiritual, (for I can not imagine that the author holdeth al the ſeed of the faithful to be carnal, and that the covenant appertaines not to any of them, ſeing ſo to affirme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts, Act. 2. 39.) And therefore becauſe the ſpiritual ſeed is not diſcerned vntil it manifeſt it ſelfe by outward profeſſion, therefore may not be baptiſed, leaſt in baptiſing them, the ſeale ſhould be ſet alſo vpon the carnal ſeed unto whom belongs not the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. To affirme this, firſt is to deny that which is done to the ſeed to whom the promiſe belongs for the wicked ſake, &amp; ſo to iniure them. 2. this reaſon alſo ſerveth as well againſt the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Iſraelites; ſeing at 8. dayes of age, they could not be diſcerned, whether they were of the carnal or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeed, &amp; ſo the ſeal of the covenant be adminiſtred to them to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the covenant did not belong: But as then the not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereof, did nothing hinder circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion to be adminiſtred to all the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Iſraelites; no more now, can the not knowing of the ſpiritual ſeed from the carnal, hinder baptiſme.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Touching the ſeed of the faithful thus I conceive thereof, that it is carnal and ſpiritual in divers reſpects; carnal, as they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſcend of their parents: ſo are they all alike borne in ſin Pſa. 51. 5. Spiritual, in reſpect of the covenant wherein they are comprehended with their parents. Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. in which regard alſo, al the children of the faithful, are ſayd to be holy, 1. Cor. 7. 14. And thus conſidered, I deny the children of the faithful to be carnal ſeed, &amp; do affirme that to ſuch belonges the covenant and the ſeale thereof. Act. 2. 39. And though ſome of them in the ſight of God be knowen for none of his, yet to vs it ſufficeth for the adminiſtration of baptiſme, that they be the ſeed of the faithful. And therfore as the Iſraelites circumciſed al there children (though ſome of them proved to be carnal afterward, as Iſmael, Eſau &amp;c.) ſo are we to baptiſe al our infants leaving the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23838:76"/> ſecreet things to God. Deut: 29. 29.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If this be ſufficient to cleare us from the profaning of the Sacrament if we baptiſe them that make confeſſion of their fayth, becauſe they ſo do, though they be not the children of God: as S. Magus. Act. 8. 13. then is it not ſimply a profaning of baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to adminiſter it to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongs not the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but to do it to them which playnely appeare to vs to be without. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if no man dare take vpon him to ſay this or that infant is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and without the covenant of grace, it ſhalbe no profanation of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it be adminiſtred vnto ſuch, ſeing we ought to hold the ſeed of the faithfull, holy. 1. Cor. 7. 14. If it be obiected (as ſome have done to me) that all the ſeed of the faithful are carnal and ſo to be held until they beleeve and make confeſſion of theire fayth. I Anſwer, 1. If they take carnal, as it is oppoſed to the children of the promiſe: Rom. 9. 8. 13. theſe two ſeeds are made ſo oppoſite by the Apoſtle as that the one can never be the other. 2. If by carnal they meane nothing els but that natural corruption wherein we are borne, that hinders infants no more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſme, then it doth thoſe that can give an account of their fayth: ſeing natural corruption remayneth ſtil in the pureſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor. Rom. 7. 23.</p>
                        <p>And if it be replyed, that their natural corruption is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them that beleeve: no more (ſay I) is it to infants, els Chriſt dyed not for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neyther could they be ſaved dying whyſt they be yong.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, if Abraham knowing that God would eſtabliſh his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to Iſaac, Gen 17. 19. yet circumciſed Iſmael verſ. 25. and Iſaac knowing that God had choſen his yonger ſon: Gen. 25. 23. with 27. 33. yet circumciſed Eſau as wel as Iacob, and in ſo doing neither of them prophaned the ſacrament: muchles is baptiſme prophaned when it is adminiſtred to the ſeed of the faithful to whom belongeth the promiſe. Act. 2. 39. and thus having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the weaknes of your reaſons againſt baptiſing of infants, let us come to the 2. poſition.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Now according to your expoſition I ſhould intend, becauſe it is not diſcerned which children are the spiritual ſeed, which the carnal, therefore both of them muſt be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of baptiſme, leaſt by giving baptiſme (which you falſely call a ſeal) to al, it ſhould be prophaned to the carnal ſeed.

                           <hi>You except againſt this expoſition two things, one that the ſpirituall ſeed ſhould be iniured by denying baptiſme unto it, for the carnal ſeeds ſake.

                        <p>Your Anſwer ſtands in begging the queſtion, I ſay it is no more an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie to baptiſme to be indifferently adminiſtred to al them to whom the covenant is indefinitely given, as it is to the ſeed of the faythfull; then it was before for circumciſion, or is now, when hypocrites are baptiſed. For we can not be ſayd to prophane the ſacrament by adminiſtring it to them that appear to us to be within the Lords covenant, as both hypocrites &amp; infants, until they break off.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An other thing you except is, that this reaſon ſhould availe against circumciſion, ſeeing the males of eight dayes old could not be diſcerned to be the spiritual ſeed. And I inſiſt that it was not then needfull, that then they ſhould be diſcerned to be the spiritual ſeed, for that carnal ſeal of that carnal covenant, it was ynough for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting of them with that carnal and typical ſeal that they were the carnal &amp; typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſeed, and that they were Iſraelites or proſelyts &amp;c.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles? And the more to cauſe them to deteſt their ſinne, likeneth them to ſuch notorious ſinners, as had taſted of the hand of God againſt them for their ſinnes. Wherefore as Iudah for her uniuſt ſhedding of blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filthy ſinnes is called Sodome and Gomorah: So the Antichriſtians are called Sodome, for their filthy ſinne of Sodomitrie, and ſuch like, wherein they become like to the Sodomites: and Egypt and Babylon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keep Gods people under a ſpirituall ſervitude, as formerly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt

And the Antichriſtians, if they be compared to the Gentiles (which I do not remember) it is in reſpect of their profanenes and ſtrange Gods: for as the Gentiles had many Gods, to whom they gave ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: ſo the Antichriſtians have their Gods, Saincts of both ſexes, and the Angels to whom they do worſhip and ſervice.

                  <p>BAbylon in Chaldea (which was a type of ſpirituall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Reve. 18. 2.) though ſhe did abuſe and profane the veſſels of the Lord, Dan. 5. 3. yet did not that make a nullitie of them, that they ceaſed any more to be the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the houſe of the Lord, but were brought with them of the captivitie that came up from Babylon, to Ieruſalem. Ezra. 1. 11. Even ſo although ſpiritual Babylon have profaned the holy things of God, as baptiſme &amp; the reſt, yet remaine they ſtill Gods ordinances to all them that come out of her, Rev. 18. 4. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the celeſtiall Ieruſalem. And as theſe veſſels of the houſe of the Lord need not to be new caſt, becauſe of Babels polluting them: no more is baptiſme to be iterated to the people of God, becauſe it paſſed through the polluted hands of the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that they that adminiſtered baptiſme in Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon were Idolaters and had no calling therevnto: I anſwere, that they which circumciſed in the Apoſtacy of Iſrael were Idolaters, &amp; ſo ſtanding in that eſtate could not be fit Miniſters of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances.

                     <p>2. Concerning the forme of baptiſme, I confeſſe it is the ſprinkling of a fit ſubject with water into the name of the Father &amp;c. but your <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deliverance up of the partie baptiſed,</hi> to make that action a part of the forme of baptiſme, al the ſcriptures you cyte, proves it not. we confeſſe that ſuch as are of yeares muſt voluntarily offer up themſelves to be baptiſed, and ſo were they that were to be circumciſed: notwithſtanding the infants that could not do this, were alſo circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed, &amp; ſo muſt our infants be baptiſed.

As for your <hi>mutual conſent of both perſons contracting together,</hi> it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of God with the faythfull &amp; their ſeed, for ſuch was the contract or covenant making with Abraham, which continues ſtil in force to al belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers &amp; their ſeed: &amp; this precedeth baptiſme, &amp; is no part of the external forme thereof.

This the papiſts apply to infants, the queſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwered by the godfathers who ar ſayd to be brought in by Higinus before whoſe time, the parents preſented their children to be baptiſed. This corrupt cuſtome &amp; apiſh imitation, your ſelf hath condemned.

                     <p>3. <hi>I anſwer that if the Antichriſtians had baptiſed perſons confeſſing their ſinnes &amp; their faith into the name of the ſonne of God and the Trinitie, it had been true baptiſme, though in the hands of the Antichriſtians, &amp;c.</hi>

That they baptiſed with water into the name of the father and of the ſonne and of the holy ghoſt, can not be denyed, all that you except againſt, is the adminiſtring of it to infants; &amp; ſo this ſecond queſtion is anſwered in the former: for if the infants are to be baptiſed, then ſtands their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme good without repeating which they have in Apoſtate Churches.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, where I ſayd, that the wanting of a lawful calling to adminiſter the Sacrament made not a nullitie thereof, inſtancing the circumciſion of the Iſraelites by Apoſtats, and of Zippora her circumciſing of her ſonne, you anſwere ſaying.</p>

Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove infants in Antichriſtianiſme to be no fit ſubiects of baptiſme, are of no weight. The firſt of them is anſwered in the former part of this writing, where is proved that infants are fit ſubiects of baptiſme. Concerning the 2. I might ask you why you make infants members of Antichriſts Church, and deny them to be members of true Churches? but to let this paſſe, I anſwere, that this reaſon is of no force, ſeing your ſelf confeſseth, <hi>that if Antichrist had baptiſed perſons confeſſing their ſinnes, &amp;c. it had bene true baptiſme.</hi> To the third I anſwer, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in Antichriſtianiſme are no more the ſeed of unbeleevers, then the infants in Ieroboams Church were the ſeed of unbeleevers: both were the ſeed of apoſtates, and that is all you can ſay of them. Their parents, (although apoſtating from many truthes, and polluted with mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,) yet were not fallen from all profeſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, but ſtil did and do acknowledge ſalvation by him; retayne and beleeve many mayne grounds of faith, &amp; excellent truthes, &amp; ſo many, as the Lord hath his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 18.</note> Babylon brought to the knowledge of God by thoſe doctrines there taught. And, therefore thus I think of ſuch apoſtates, that in reſpect of their outward ſtanding they remaine in apoſtaſie, having forſaken many truthes, pollute Gods ordinances, practiſe the curſed inventions of men: yet profeſsing faith in God &amp; in Ieſus Chriſt (though corruptly) I can not hold them as infidels ſimply, but as the Iſraelites in their apoſtaſie: and their ſeed may rather be termed the ſeed of Apoſtates, then of infidels or vnbeleevers.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſpeak comparatively of the ſeeds of the apoſtate Iſraelites and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians, affirming the one as fit ſubiects for baptiſme, as the other for circumciſion, becauſe the Gentiles ſince Chriſt, have as much title to the covenant with Abraham, as the Iſraelites had. This you deny, ſhifting off with your deviſed carnal covenant. It is not for the ſpirituall covenant or Sacrament, to belong to Apoſtates, that I contend: I know it belongs to the faithful and their ſeed, though you <hi>ſay no.</hi> But this was the end wherefore I did alledge Gal. 3. 14. to prove that the covenant is inlarged to the Gentiles and that they may now make as iuſt clayme to it for them ſelves and their ſeed, as Iſrael could do. And therefore did reaſon thus: If the children of Iſrael could chalendg right to the covenant and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their parents being in Apoſtacy: then might the infants of Apoſtats in Antichriſtianiſme do ſo: and this is all that I ſayd, not iuſtifying the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the one or of the other.</p>

                     <p>Firſt I have proved that baptiſme which is adminiſtred in the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian<note place="margin">Rep.</note> churches is not to be iterated: but that Chriſt appointed baptiſme in the kingdome of Antichriſt, I do not affirm; onely this I ſay, that Chriſt ordeyned this ſacrament for his church, which becoming Apoſtate &amp; yet reteyning the ſame, is notwithſtanding baptiſme, becauſe it is of God. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23838:93"/> ſo I affirme that Chriſt is the Author of baptiſme, which the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans pollute by their adminiſtration thereof, as God was the author of that circumciſion obſerved in the apoſtate church of Iſrael. And therefore as circumciſion received of the Iſraelites in their Apoſtaſie, ſtood as the ſeal of Gods covenant to ſo many as repented: So baptiſme received in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon confirmeth the promiſe to al Gods people departing thence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to walk in the wayes of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the matter and forme of baptiſme you charge me to have ſayd in my anſwer to your ſecond Argument, <hi>That water is the matter and the forme waſhing with water into the Trinitie.</hi> In calling water the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſo it had pleaſed you, you might have underſtood my meaning, viz. that I underſtood thereby the outward ſigne or element, whereof in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was no change. They uſed the ſame which Chriſt ordeyned. And in calling it the matter, I did not intend the ſubject or partie baptiſed (which I know muſt be alſo one that beleeveth, or the ſeed of ſuch,) but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Chriſt ordeyned to be obſerved in this Ceremonie, I found theſe: water, and the baptiſing therewith into the name of the father, &amp;c. The former I called the matter or element wherewith the partie is baptiſed, meaning that material outward ſigne, that Chriſt ordeyned in this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in the other, he hath done the like. For it was not in my thought to intend, that if the water be adminiſtred with this forme of words, that it is baptiſme without a fit ſubject to be baptiſed: Nay I hold it an error in the Papiſts which baptiſe their bells, and wil have bread conſecrated (as they ſpeak) to be a ſacrament, though it be never received but layed up in a box.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſubject of baptiſme or matter (as you terme it) I wil not contend: but in that you denye the Infants of beleevers to be fit matter of baptiſme, the contrarie I affirme and have proved before.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>I ſay that waſhing into the name of the father of the ſonne &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>

                     <p>I anſwer, firſt, I know that formes can not conſiſt without their ſubjects,<note place="margin">Re.</note> &amp; therefore I ſay, the forme of baptiſing is reteyned in Poperie, applied to infants, though corruptly in that ſtanding. Secondly, I ſtand not to defend, that to baptiſe an unfit ſubject is true baptiſme: but this, that the baptiſme of Apoſtates is not to be iterated when they repent and turne to God no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23838:94"/> no more then the circumciſio of the Iſraelites in the like cauſe, 2 Chro. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3. That infants are to be baptiſed, I have already proved.

Now if you wil make your argument (which ſtands vpon compariſon) anſwerable, you muſt bring like warrant from the Scripture, that you being vnbaptiſed, may baptiſe your ſelfe, or els that which we have done ſhalbe iuſtified to be of God, and your baptiſme prove but a vayne fanſie. Further I deſire it may be ſhewed, that baptiſme, which is a part of the worke of the Miniſtery, can lawfully, and by warrant from God, be adminiſtred by any, but eyther by extraordinary authority, as by Iohn, Ananias, the Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts: or ordinary, as by Paſtors and Teachers. Or that a perſon vnbaptiſed without ſpeciall commaundement from heaven (for ordinary rule there is none) may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe himſelfe, and having ſo done without any further calling to office, take vpon him to baptiſe others. And to do this, I would knowe, if it be<note place="margin">Cor. 4. 6</note> not † <hi>to preſume above that which is written.</hi> For if you that baptiſe your ſelf (being but an ordinary man) may this do, then may an other do the like and ſo every one baptiſe himſelfe. You that ſtand ſo much for commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and example, ſhew vs eyther of theſe two if you can, or any ſound reaſon out of the word? or els conſider wel, if that you be not fallen into that, which you would condemne in others, viz. the practiſing of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable action. But you ſay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A true Church cannot be erected without baptiſme &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this be ſo as you ſay, then eyther that baptiſme which we receaved in the Antichriſtian aſſemblyes is baptiſme, or els one that is no member of a Church may induce the forme (as you cal it) vpon Diſciples, to make them a Church, and this have we neyther commaundement nor example for. He that was the firſt Miniſter of baptiſme ſtode then a member of the Church of the Iewes, &amp; had alſo commaundement to baptiſe: but this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:23838:98"/> new doctrine teacheth that one that was never member of any Church ſhall baptiſe &amp; make a Church, &amp; that without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from God.

                     <p>Firſt for the viſible ordinances of Chriſt, his Church hath right unto them, and his people are to have the vſe of them by ſuch means and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as he hath appointed: but every man may not take upon him the adminiſtration of theſe ordinances, but * they whom the Lord hath given<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> authoritie and office thereunto.

And therefore they muſt be let alone til they may be had by that rule that Chriſt hath left vs for the injoying of the ſame. For this I am ſure of, that the word of the Lord is perfect, and CHRIST hath left vs certayne directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the practiſing of al his ordinances at all tymes. Now if the Scripture have not ſhewed who ſhal baptiſe in the Churches ariſing out of Apoſtacy, then who dare take vpon him to give direction? And though we are not to loke for extraordinary men (which to do, ſay you, <hi>were familiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>) yet muſt we loke for ordinary meanes: men muſt not do that which they are not warranted by the word, though the thing be to be done.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for two being ioyned together in covenant with the Lord, to walk in his wayes, they have * warrant ſo to do (if there be no viſible Church for them to ioyne unto) although I do not approve that every two<note place="margin">Mat. 18</note> or three ſhall ioyne together &amp; ſo walk, when they may conveniently ioyne to a Church ſet already in the wayes of God; neyther may they attempt any thing beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their meaſure &amp; calling, leaſt they fal into the ſinne of Corah &amp;c. And as for two baptiſing themſelves or one an other, that can they not do without calling from God. And therefore you not having calling herevnto, &amp; being as you ſay vnbaptiſed, I pray you tel me how you are authoriſed by Chriſt herevnto, &amp; conjoyned into his name?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23838:99"/> The Admiſtration of Baptiſme is by Chriſt <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 19. Ephe. 4. 11 12.</note> commaunded to his Apoſtles and Miniſters of the word, as before is ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>As for your reaſon which is: <hi>That els they can not conioyne into Chriſt, but by baptiſme.</hi> I anſwer, we may be ioyned into Chriſt, by being vnited in one ſpirit into his covenant of life.

                     <p>But graunt that this was a ſpecial precept to the ſtranger to circumciſe himſelf and his familie, the Lord laying this upon him, he had good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Neyther is this to follow the example of the Proſelytes, if they had done as you alleadge: for then the Maſter onely and none els circumciſed, and he circumciſed but his familie. But this new opinion inableth any man, be he Maſter or ſervant to baptiſe himſelf, and alſo to baptiſe others that are not of his familie. Note wel how this example ſerves to your purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit for circumciſion, I take it, that it was adminiſtred by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites after that they were called of office, becauſe <note n="†" place="margin">

And therefore to adde a ſecond baptiſme, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, is to Apoſtate from Chriſt, and not to enter into his covenant.</p>
                     <p>And in that the Apoſtles receaved in members by baptiſme, they could do no otherwiſe, ſeing the whole world was vnbaptiſed: but if they had mett with any that before had bene baptiſed into the name of Chriſt, as they that received the baptiſme of Iohn, and as we are, I make no queſtion they did not, nor would not have rebaptiſed them.

                        <p>And this difference between this Covenant and the law and ordinances of the old Teſtament, if it pleaſe you to take notice of, will anſwer your queſtion about ſucceſſion. Yet I would not have you miſtake me, for although I hold in this ſenſe a continual ſucceſſion of the people of God partakers of this covenant of ſalvation, I affirme not that there hath been alway, and at al tymes known eſtabliſhed churches, keeping ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the ordinances of Chriſt, and making viſible profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In the Apoſtacie of Iſrael the Lord had his ſeven thowſand that never bowed their knee to Baal, to whom this covenant belonged, and ſo had he in <note n="“" place="margin">

                        <p>Again, we fetch not a ſucceſſion of Baptiſme from Moſes, otherwiſe then the Apoſtles have taught us. Col. 2. 10. - 12. 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 3. 20. 21. The ſealing of the covenant was commanded to Abraham, and never repealed (ſave onely the outward ſigne changed, as before is ſayd.) And as we fetch no otherwiſe ſucceſſion from Moſes or the old Teſtament, then hath been ſayd: No more do we ſucceſſion of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, or of any other ordinance of Chriſt, but in like manner and upon like warrant. 2. Concerning fetching of ſucceſſion of our church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome becauſe of our Baptiſme: I anſwer, 1. that Baptiſme, as alſo the Scriptures were given to the Church of Rome when ſhe was a true church and ſhe retayning them in her Apoſtaſie, we receive them as Chriſte word and baptiſme, though continued through her corrupt Miniſterie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. 2. If (according to your terming) ſucceſſion of Baptiſme be graunted, (being an ordinance of God,) yet will it not followe, that therefore we muſt reteyn the whoredomes of the church of Rome (which we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ſeparate from, Rev. 18. 4) becauſe we retein baptiſme, but rather thus, as we have baptiſme fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, ſo are we to have the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our church, &amp; what is polluted in eyther by Antichriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reject.</p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:23838:105"/>
                        <p>3. Our retayning of baptiſme adminiſtred in the Apoſtate churches, doth no more prove that we fetch ſucceſſion of our church from Rome: then the Iſraelites, that were circumciſed in the church of Ieroboam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Ieruſalem did fetch the ſucceſsion of their church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate church of Iſrael.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected that this people now ſeparated from that Apoſtacy, were matter of that falſe church: and ſo we fetch a ſucceſſion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our church from a falſe church. I anſwer, that al ſuch of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſtand members of thoſe Antichriſtian aſſemblies muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two wayes. 1. in reſpect of us and their outward ſtanding, ſo are they members of thoſe Aſſemblies: 2. in reſpect of the Lord and their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo are they no members thereof, but the matter of Gods inviſible church in tyme becoming viſible. As on the contrarie in a viſible church, al the people thereof in our account are held true members, yet † hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 19.</note> in the Lords account, are no members or matter thereof. And as the Apoſtle ſayth of Antichriſts, <hi>if they had been of us, they ſhould have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us:</hi> ſo I ſay of Gods people in Babilon, if they had been of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian church they ſhould have continued with them, but by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, it appeares that they are not of them, and therefore we cannot be ſayd to have the matter of our church by ſucceſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichriſtianiſme: but by the gracious work of God in his people of al ages, and (to uſe your word of Succeſſion) as it were by a ſecret and hidden ſucceſſion, even from the Apoſtles tymes. And thus it wil not follow (as you ſay) that we make <hi>the church of Rome a true church.</hi>

Neyther Infants nor the elder ſort ſtanding in Antichriſtianiſm, can be the matter of a true viſible Church, being ſo looked vpon according to that eſtate and reſpect. 3. Baptiſme (which you would have the form) hath his true uſe in the viſible Church of Chriſt, and to Gods people. 4. let the people of God in Babylon and the Baptiſme that there they receive, be compared with Gods people in the apoſtate Church of Iſrael, &amp; with their circumciſion: And it will appeare that the infants of the Church of Rome are not a true viſible Church, in the eſſential cauſes therof, any more or otherwiſe, then as they were in Iſrael. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Churches ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by carnal genealogie, I anſwer, that as the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his ſeed; ſo vnder the Goſpell, doth the promiſe belong to the parents &amp; their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                        <p>Now it is further to be remembred, that we in retayning baptiſme, do not retayn the corruptions wherewith it was adminiſtred, but that which is of God therein: Neyther do we hold it lawful for them that are come out of Babylon, to returne thither to fetch Baptiſme. And to make this difference to appeare more playnly, Let be conſidered the example of thoſe Iſraelites that returned to Ieruſalem, who caſt not of theire circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet might they not iuſtify for true, that apoſtate Church or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery from which they did ſeparate, or continue in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion thereof without ſinne.</p>

This is a ſtrange kind of reaſoning, that becauſe the Antichriſtians reſemble the Gentiles in ſome filthie practiſes, for the which the ſpirit calls them Sodomites, &amp;c. therefore their condition in al reſpects, is as theirs. Chriſt called Peter Sathan, ſhal we thereupon conclude, that therefore Peter was as Sathan in al reſpects, becauſe in his counſeling his maſter to favour himſelf, he was like him? Of Iudah it is ſayd, that ſhe was more † corrupt in al her wayes, then Samaria and Sodome, ſhal we ſay (becauſe the Lord thus ſpeaketh) that Iudah was now to be recircumciſed? If the holy Ghoſt calling the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians Sodomites &amp;c. ſhould teach us thereby, that he eſteemeth no otherwiſe of the church and Baptiſme, then of the Synagogues of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the waſhings of Aegypt, then of the worſhip of Sodome and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans (as you ſay) then muſt he needs teach us, the like to eſteeme of the churches of the Iewes, and of the circumciſion, when he calls them the people of Gomorrah, and more corrupt in her wayes then Sodome, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have obſerved.</p>
                        <p>For your compariſon of the <hi>Gentiles waſhings, with the baptiſme of Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> affirming, <hi>that as the former were nothing, no more is the other.</hi> This is not to compare things alike: for the waſhings of the Gentiles were of mans invention, and baptiſme is the ordinance of Chriſt.

And other forme or frame can no earthly power devyſe then that which the Apoſtles have left us. And ſeing at the firſt they did conſtitute churches in divers partes of the world, and thoſe churches ruinated by Antichriſt: ſhal not the reſtoring of them to the firſt patterne of the Apoſtles, be properly called a repairing? ſeing they did not ceaſe utterly to be no churches, but are churches in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ruine. But I wil not contend about words, for that which I ſtrive for, is, to have the church in that forme as the word preſcribeth, both for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worſhip, goverment, and what els appertaynes thereunto.</p>

                           <hi>Zelotes did ſpread the goſpel of Christ to the weſt Ocean, and brought the ſame into the Iſles of Britayne.</hi> 5. In the time of the Abbot of Cluniake, the Scots did celebrate their Eaſter, not after the Romane maner, but after the Greeks, as he teſtifieth to Barnard. Which argueth that they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the faith, and not from Rome. 6. Alſo it appeareth by a letter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutherius Biſhop of Rome written to Lucius King of Britayne, anno 169. that Lucius had received the faith of Chriſt in his Land, before he ſent to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutherius for the Romane lawes: for ſo do the words of the letter purport, which are theſe:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have receiued of late through Gods mercie in the Realme of Britayne, the law and faith of Chriſt: you have with you within the Realme both the partes of the ſcriptures, out of them by Gods grace take ye a law, and by that law, through Gods ſufferance rule your kingdome of Britayne, &amp;c.</hi> And thus was fulfilled in Britayne as wel as in<note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 4</note> other lands the words of the Prophet, who ſayth, “<hi>he ſhall not fayle nor be diſcouraged,</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>til he hath ſet iudgement in the earth, and the Iles ſhall waite for his law.</hi> And it is alſo further written of this King Lucius, that he did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel the heathen, but imbraced ſuch as by the word were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Which is to be obſerved concerning the conſtitution of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then. For it is ſayd, <hi>that he founded many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches, and gave great ritches and liberties to the ſame.</hi> And becauſe of this imbracing of the faith, it cauſed thoſe great troubles that fel out between the Britaynes which were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans profeſſing the faith, and the infidels, who brought in the Romanes which exerciſed much crueltie amongeſt the Chriſtians. In Diocleſians tyme the Churches of Britayne were greviouſly perſecuted &amp; many ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the faith of Chriſt, as <hi>Albanus, Iulius, Aaron, Amphibulus</hi> &amp; many more.</p>
                        <p>And thus if it pleaſe you to take notice from theſe writters, you may ſee that this Engliſh nation were of ſuch as profeſſed the faith of Chriſt and and not of a Pagan race, til Rome came and put vppon vs falſe baptiſme, as as you ſay, neyther that our caſe is ſimply paganiſme, if theſe things be thus, as is aforeſayd.</p>

That the baptiſme of Antichriſt is not true baptiſme, I graunt, and do alſo affirme that al members of Chriſt muſt have true baptiſme, and what then? muſt it follow, that now ſuch as are baptiſed, muſt be rebaptiſed, els cannot be members of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church? I deny it, and do further anſwer, 1. That the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which we received in the Apoſtate church is no more Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, then the word that we received therein: For Antichriſt did never ordeyn a new kind of baptiſme, but did onely pollute with his inventions that holy ordinance of Chriſt. And therfore if this baptiſme that we have received, be called the baptiſme of Antichriſt, it is to affirme an untruth, ſeing the inſtitution thereof was by Ieſus Chriſt, who commanded his Apoſtles to baptiſe all nations with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, &amp; of the H.

                        <p>2.

                           <p>Firſt, I grant that we ought to ſeparate from all falſe or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Churches. Apoc. 18. 4. and to adioyne our ſelves to a true Church, reformed according to the patterne of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. 2. Alſo every falſe Miniſterie is to be forſaken, Mat. 7. 15. 2 Iohn, 10. Gal. 1. 8. and the true Miniſters of God to be received. Ier. 3. 14. 15. as did the faithfull in Iſrael, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the falſe Preiſts ſet vp by Ieroboam and returned to the Preiſts of the Lord to Ieruſalem, 2 Chron. 30. 11. 3. It is our dutie likewiſe to renounce all falſe worſhip, 2 Cor. 6. 14-17. Eſa. 30. 22. and to worſhip the Lord as he taught vs in his word. And thus farre do I approve of this reaſon, but the conſequence I muſt deny, viz. that becauſe falſe worſhip is to be renounced, therefore baptiſme alſo. For 1. we are to conſider in that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23838:114"/> received in apoſtate Churches two things, firſt that which is of God therein, ſecondly, that which is of man: that which is of God, is the ſubſtance of baptiſme, as before is obſerved, viz. the ſame matter and forme which the Lord inſtituted and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame end, which is the profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt: and this is not falſe worſhip, and ſo conſequently not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.

For if pollution might warrant men to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>2. I anſwer, that we have received as true Baptiſme in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Church as the people of God, did circumciſion amongſt the 10. Tribes: And therefore we may no more renounce it, and to aſſume a new, then they that returned to Ieruſalem. 2 Chron. 30. 11. might renounce their circumciſion, &amp; be recircumciſed.</p>
                           <p>It is obiected of ſome, that this compariſon holdes not, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſrael was a true Church, and therefore their circumciſion was true: But an apoſtate Church hath nothing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>This obiection, in part I have anſwered before, and now anſwer further. 1. that the Iſraelites in their apoſtaſie were not a true Church, but a falſe: ſeing they ſeparated from Ieruſalem the true and onely Church in the world: and erected a new Church and communion amongſt themſelves, ioyning together in a falſe worſhip and under a falſe Miniſterie, 1. King. 12. 30.-33. and 18. 19.-21. and ſo became an Harlot, Hoſea 2. 2.</p>
                           <p>Secondly in the Apoſtate Church, there be ſome things true in the ſubſtance, as the word and Baptiſme, though corrupted in the adminiſtration thereof by falſe Miniſters and humane deviſes.</p>
                           <p>3. The members of an apoſtate Church are to be conſidered two wayes. 1. as they ſtand members of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ch a Church: 2. as they are the ſeed and poſteritie of their forefathers, which received the covenant for themſelves and their ſeed. And though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the former eſtate, they have neyther right to baptiſme or the covenant (for the holy thinges of God belonges not to falſe Churches properly) yet even to ſuch members conſidered a part from ſuch ſtanding, and as they are the ſeed of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo are they capable of the covenant and ſacrament, and the ſame is avayleable to them upon their repentance. For in apoſtate Churches God hath his people which are beloved for their fathers ſakes. Rom. 11. 28. &amp; this appeareth in that he ſayth, come out of her my people. Apoc. 18. 4. And to ſuch it can not be denyed, but that to them belonges the covenant: yea whiles they are in ſpiritual Babylon, as it did to the Iewes that were in Babylon of Chaldea. Bondage hinders not Gods grace.</p>
                           <p>But ſome may reply, that they whoſe fathers were idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and unbeleevers could have no right to the covenant to be baptiſed through the faith of theire fathers. I anſwer, the right
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23838:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> that children have to Gods covenant depends not onely vpon their immediate parents, but title therevnto deſcends vnto them from their anceſtors, Exod. 20. (if we reſpect herein Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,) even as mens inheritances do from their former fathers. Neyther do the members of an apoſtate Church, caſt of all pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, for they beleeve the ſcriptures, and in Chriſt, &amp;c. though withall they profeſſe divers errors, and worſhip the true God in a falſe manner.</p>
                           <p>If queſtion be made how it can be proved that the members of an apoſtate Church, had forefathers that beleeved. I anſwer, it can not be denyed, ſeing that an apoſtate Church ariſeth not out of a company of infidels (for then could it not be called apoſtate, ſeing that to apoſtate, muſt be in regard of the truth) but is the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of a true Church: and therfore it muſt needs folow that their forefathers were beleevers and had received the covenant.</p>
                           <p>And thus haue I briefly anſwered theſe two Anabaptiſtical Poſitions with their Reaſons, as the Lord hath inabled me for the preſent, wiſhing this labour might have bene taken in hand by ſuch as could perform it better. And further intreat that the truth (which I contend for) may not, by my weak defence beare any reproch, but that which is falt worthy, let it returne vpon my head.

                        </p>
                        <p>This place of Rom. 11. 28. I have before expounded, Pag. 218. And that any is beloved for their parents ſake, (otherwiſe then in reſpect of gods free promiſe made vnto them and their ſeed,) I meane not. Yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Lords diſpenſation of his covenant, according to his grace of choſing a people to himſelf, (of which the Apoſtle alſo ſpeaketh, Rom. 11. chap.) and how he conveigheth the ſame to the ſeed of beleevers, then it may be ſayd, that God loveth the children for the fathers fake, with whom the Lord had made his covenant ſo to love them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Not for that the children ſhalbe partakers of that covenant becauſe of their parents fayth, or becauſe of Gods covenant made with their parents and their carnal infants, but becauſe God elected them in Christ to life inviſibly, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The children of beleevers are partakers of Gods covenant, becauſe the Lord of his free gift and mercie giving it vnto their parents, includeth their ſeed with them, as before I haue proved.

You muſt prove that ſome of our Predeceſsors had that actual faith and were members of true Churches, and this you must prove for every member you receive in without baptiſme, thereby to aſſure you that he had title to the covenant and baptiſme, by his carnal line. 2. You muſt by the ſame reaſon receave by baptiſm, if you can come by them, all the infants of the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, Galatians, Colloſſians, Philippians and Churches of Aſia that did ſometime beleeve. 3. I deny that you expound that place, Exod. 20. truely, for the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly doth require that they, vpon whom he ſheweth mercy ſhould feare him and keep his commaundements, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the firſt particular, I anſwer, in that our Predeceſſors were all in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſ.</note> yt argueth that they deſcended from beleevers. Apoſtaſie muſt be from the faith once publikly defended: And where there is a publik face
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23838:120"/> of an Apoſtate church, there was formerly a publike face of a church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing the truth, from which they are fallen. And even their retayning of baptiſme to this day, is a confirmation thereof. Againe, this is witneſſed by them that came out of Babylon, that they are deſcended from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whoſe ſeed the Lord now remembreth in his mercy, to do good unto. But we are not to ſtand upon particulars, the general eſtate ſheweth what was the precedent eſtate of Antichriſtians: neyther are we to inquire any more into the particular condition of their Predeceſſors or parents, that come out of Babylon, then they of Ieruſalem did inquire into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eſtates of the forefathers of thoſe Iſraelites, that left the Apoſtate church of Ieroboam to joyne unto them. For receiving in without baptiſme you are anſwered before.</p>
                        <p>To your ſecond particular I anſwer, that the eſtate of them muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether theſe be in Apoſtaſie as Rome is, or be quite fallen from the fayth, and be no churches at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as infidels that beleeve not in Ieſus Chriſt and his word: if their eſtate were but apoſtaſie, and that they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Scriptures, worſhipped God and reteyned baptiſme, (though all theſe in a corrupt manner) then ſhould we do alike unto them, as we do to the papiſts. But if they were become infid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly, for receiving the infants of the Theſſalonians &amp;c. if we can come by them, we hold it thus, if their parents returne to the Lord and his church, or if ſome of the faythful undertake their education as their own children.</p>
                        <p>In the third particular you deny, that I expound the place of Exod. 20. 6. truly. My words are ſet down before, pag. 213. And my meaning was this, that concerning thoſe that ar born in an apoſtate church, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth his covenant made with their forefathers that beleeved, &amp; doth cal of their ſeed, (whom it pleaſeth him) to the knowledge of his truth, &amp; fayth in Chriſt, not regarding their immediate idolatrous and apoſtate<note place="margin">

For the Lord that knoweth the ſecrets of the hart, is witneſſe, that I have not of purpoſe to mainteyne any untruth wittingly, ſtopped myne eares, or ſhut vp mine eyes from any truth revealed vnto me, for any ſiniſter cauſe or prejudice of your perſon: but if I did ſee any further truth, I would (the Lord aſſiſting me) receive it with all thankfulnes. Neyther do I hang my faith vpon the perſons of men, but upon the word of God, to be charmed by evil counſel, (evil you call that which condemneth your errors) but if by any man I receive further inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Lords truth, you ought not, nor ſhall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, call it charming, or what you wil. I would to God you were no worſe charmed by the counſel of Satan, then I am by thoſe whom you point at, in theſe your ſpeeches, I doubt not but we ſhould then walk together comfortably in the houſe of God.</p>
                        <p>I have ſhewed you your error, as you deſire. And for this truth (as you falſely call it) that you would be glad to impart unto me, I dare not herein make you glad, but wiſh rather that you might be ſory, that wee might reioyce in your converſion.
